0,One Direction,,"Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed 
Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart 
I tore it apart 
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence 
And no woman in the world deserves this 
But here I am asking you for one more chance 

Can we fall, one more time? 
Stop the tape and rewind 
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade 
Cause there is nobody else 

It's gotta be you 
Only you 
It's gotta be you 
Only you 

Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles 
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was 
You've almost had enough 
And your actions speak louder than words 
And you're about to break from all you've heard 
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where 

I'll be here, by your side 
No more fears, no more crying 
But if you walk away 
I know I'll fade 
Cause there is nobody else 

It's gotta be you 
Only you 
It's gotta be you 
Only you 

Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time? 
One more, one more, can we try? 
One more, one more time 
I'll make it better 
One more, one more, can we try? 
One more, one more, 
Can we try one more time to make it all better? 

Cos its gotta be you 
Its gotta be you 
Only you 
Only you 

It's gotta be you 
Only you 
It's gotta be you 
Only you!",Pop

Her name is Noel
I have a dream about her

It's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even the landslide or riptide
Could take it all the way

Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

When i close my eyes
All the stars are lined
And you are by my side
You are by my side

Once in a lifetime
It's just right
That we are always safe

Not even the bad guys, in the dark night
Could take it all the way

Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same

Out loud, someone´s calling my name

I won't act my age, no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
Hey!

When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
Cause the stories that I told, I tell again and again
I can count on you after all we got up to
Cause I know that you truly understand

No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age

We'll still stay up till morning
We'll throw an after party, oh yeah, oh yeah

like the headphones in my pocket
Two words and you got me

Two nights and you told me that
Once the time is counting down,

it's impossible to stop it
Three words that we need to save

Three weeks till you move away
So go, go oh oh oh oh oh

Gotta be somebody, be someone
'Cause we (oh oh oh) got a dream (oh oh oh)

Gotta be somebody, be someone
So please, be somebody with me

I'm clinging to old news
Memories I'm scared to loose
Now I find reminders down the sofa and under the bed

Three words could've made you stay
Three words that I left to late
So go, go oh oh oh oh oh

Your heart has to be followed

'Cause we (oh oh oh) got a dream (oh oh oh)
Gotta be somebody, be someone
'Cause we (oh oh oh) got a dream (oh oh oh)

So please, be somebody with me

The grass is greener inside your heart
And I'll be there if it falls apart

If you only knew
I'm hanging by a thread
The web I spin for you
If you only knew
I'd sacrifice my beating
Heart before I lose you
I still hold onto the letters
You returned
I swear I've lived and learned

Back to life
Breathe your breath in me

In is you, if you only knew

If you only knew
How many times I counted
All the words that wen't wrong
If you only knew
How I refuse to let you go,
Even when you're gone
I don't regret any days I
Spent, nights we shared,
Or letters that I sent

Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

Searching is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right

And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time

With me you're winning, girl, you don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other guys? I can see right through ya

You seem like the type to love them and leave them

It just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt

And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live and we learn

And we try and try and try and try

Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again

Bet they could never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had the highlight

It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two
Who knew?

Now we don't wanna fall
But we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was a destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I got you, baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause in a way it's gonna end right
But we are both too foolish to stop

Cold world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to decide we
And I ain't with it

And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince is just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another place

'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

At the table with the family, having dinner
BlackBerry on a hip and then became a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before what activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie, Bieber hit me on the Twitter

Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, ""Let's make it hot up in the winter""

I said ""cool you know Imma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger""

Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping
How he know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now

Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah

When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair

It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by fire and toys and their dolls

Not thinking there's a family out, hungry and cold
Waiting, wishing that they had somebody they can hold
So I think some of you need to act bold

Ooh it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd man I should've known
Why why you're doing what you do
You you might as well just tell the honest truth
See I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
Know I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

And you sound really dumb right now

Giving too much cause you hate that you love 
Everything that he do and you can't deny you want him

I was all alone
Nobody round

Look at what you found
I was lonely for some time
Now it's only you and I
I won't leave without your love tonight, tonight

Every verse, every song, every feature I was on
Better know that I abused it
If I die before my time I'll still be living through my music
I cracked the industry open, but still got this shit on lock
Even on the highway up to heaven Luda still would be on top

I feel it when you fall apart

I don't wanna change your mind
Coz I accept you for everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now

Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away

I can't tell you what the future holds
Or how to live
All I know is what feels right lights up my life again and again

95,Miley Cyrus,,"Oh yeah
Come on

You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color

Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers

In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds

The best of both worlds

You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio
Livin' two lives is a little weird
But school's cool cause nobody knows

Yeah you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both
You know the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best parts that you get to be who ever you wanna be

(Best! Best!) Yeah, the best of both!
(Best! Best!) You got the best of both!
(Best! Best!) Come on, the best of both!

Who would of thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds

You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere

You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together

It might be crazy
I do it anyway

I try to be delicate

When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same

So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

A lot to say but not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive

A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about
This song I ever liked

You know nothing hurts like losing
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old

So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your taillights fading
I try but it still won't fall

I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
I can't think of what I learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know, it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old

So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late

Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you’ll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true, with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me

[Verse 2]
Now how about I’d be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, and you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you’re worth it

It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

No I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk

She got expensive taste she get it from her momma 
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL 
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider 
I'm in heaven when I am inside her 
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck 
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct 
Have her drippin wet

And he's got something special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl
Come in right here?
Yeah, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street

Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now? Mama, listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my

Running fast in my mind
Girl, won't you slow it down?
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground

How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Well, hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love

I'll work harder for you, girl

See they don't do this anymore

I don't no but I'm thinking 'bout really leaving with you

Guys sing

Keeps coming closer, I don't but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type, amnesia, that’s over
I can see you breathing, girl, it's colder -
I can see you need me but I don’t care
My whole memory of me and I’ve gone so far from me, girl
It’s not fair
I could feel it almost starts to change
But then it hurts too much, that’s when it starts to fade

[Chorus]
So cold baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you'd leave me alone.
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think, don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: everything and nothing
No 'we' anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Now these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened?
Who were they? Where did they go?
When was enough, enough?
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love's gone so far from me, it's not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change
But it just hurts too much, I let it go away

[Chorus]
So cold baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you'd leave me alone.
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?, don’t you think I would know?

Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot, who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see you, see you
Thought I could do without you
Now I know I need you, need you
This is turning into some kind, kind of amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it every time I see you, see you
Thought I could do without you
Now I know I need you, need you
This is turning into some kind, kind of amnesia, amnesia

We go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?

'Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way

Could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?

A tall shot of pain.
Pour a little up now for the love that we've made.

I feel it in the morning.
You’re still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: I’m not okay.
The bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Don’t change the truth.
I tried it but I can’t.

I can’t drink you away.
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends.
But I can’t drink you away.
All these rocks–I can’t swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.

Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break, ooh?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Got a pounding on my brain.
So I drowned it away.
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doing the same.
'Cause I just can’t forget
The way we turned out this bad/bed.
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead.

And then I feel it in the morning.

Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya

There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

[Verse 1]
Red was the color of her eyes
When she put me in a meditation states
Her skin was white, so white
Look like it had no expiration dates
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

[Bridge:]
Aw, give it to me now (so evil in the dress)
It circulates, you start to feel it (devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to invoke the spirits (got you on the floor)
She comes alive when you're the killing (hungry for some more)

[Hook:]
Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's the demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
[2x]
(It makes me say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type she told me that she found her perfect blood mate

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Rose me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna freak
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle (candle...)

I taste your blood
And found out you was the perfect fit

Come on mama
Go and show me what you’re working with

Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face
Looking in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do
Was apologize

You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me, again
No, no, no, no, no, no

Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless watched you break this heart of mine
And loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do
Was apologize, and mean it

But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me

It's like hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late, it's over now

You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough

Walking around middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'mma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level

Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police

Faces of death, she fine or what

Your smile make my day it's simple, your dimple 
Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized 
Communication is deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk 
You make a nigga forget about a life full of DRAMA
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma 
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL 
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider 
I'm in heaven when I am inside her 
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck 
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct 
Have her drippin wet
She look in my eye and said she like but I know she love it

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I’m capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
Don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy


So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away

It’s in the palm of your hand now baby
It’s a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for

Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

She’s a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty’s heart was on steroids
Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I’m sprung and I don’t care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted 

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here living
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the K K K

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love
(Love)

Where is the love
(The love)
Where is the love
(The love)
Where is the love
The love, the love

It just ain't the same, always unchanged
New days are strange, is the world insane
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin', as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone

So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on
(I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on
(I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach

Where is the love
(Love)

Where is the love
(The love)
Where is the love
(The love)
Where is the love
The love, the love

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' our wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
(So ask yourself)
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek

A version of my ghetto where life felt for real

Some would call it hell, but to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace, amazin' ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch your meal?
Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in

Having to pump the water outta the ground

To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal

Meant I felt complete, my emotions I feel

162,Black Eyed Peas,,"Johnny wanna be a big star
Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and a alligator

Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man, so, he's no longer singin' the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go blink

But diamonds don't blink in the dark
He a star now but he ain't singing from the heart
Sooner or later, he's just gonna fall apart
'Cuz his fans can't relate to his newfound art

He ain't doing what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Passion is love for material

And it's gone, gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people, up awkward with their things
Gone

You see yourself in the mirror and ya
Feel safe 'cuz it looks familiar but ya
Afraid to open up your soul 'cuz ya
Don't really know, don't really know

Who is the person that's deep within
'Cuz your content with just being the naive brown man
And ya fail to see that it's trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material

I've seen your kind before
Your the type that thinks souls is sold in a store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With them vegetarian meals, to you thats righteous

You're fiction like books
You need to go out to life and look
'Cuz what happens when they take your material
And you already sold ya soul

And it's gone, gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people, up awkward with their things
Gone

You say that time is money and money is time
So, you got mind in ya money and ya money on ya mind
But what about that crime thatcha did to get paid?
And what about that bid? You can't take it to your brain

And what about those shoes you're in today, they'll be no good
On the bridges, you've walked along the way

All that money that you got, gon' be gone
That gear that you rock, gon' be gone
The house up on the hill, gon' be gone
The gold fronts on your grill, gon' be gone

The ice on your wrist, gon' be gone
That nice little miss, gon' be gone
That whip that you roll, gon' be gone
And what's worst is your soul already gone

It is gone, gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people, up awkward with their things

So we could make plans for Thursday night
He said, ""We could go hit the peapods""
I was like, â€½Yeah, that's my favorite spot""

Plus I like it there 'cuz I got love on the list
High powered juice where I don't even get frisked
Walk up in the place and get love from the misses
Pounds from my brothers 'cuz they knowin' that disses

The place to be to let it all out
But when the weekend come, the weekend come
Y'all could come
So go tell ya momma come and ya papa come

Go to spin the record so we can get dumb
Place packed, capacity maximum
Due to my man Polo Promotion
And I can't wait to go out and hear some

Jumpin' music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend 'cuz here I come
Because weekends were, were

Walk in the club at like 10 o' clock
And the spot is hot, blowin' up rooftops
It's Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun

DJ's scutter up, drop them joints
Everybody's been waitin' to dance and make noise
B-boys, let me see you break it down
And ladies, let your hips move around

It's the sound of the B.E.P. family
Got a poet named, 'Life And A Sister Kimy'
(Word up)
And the blood of Abraham
(Word up)
So let's get ready for the jam

Jumpin' music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend 'cuz here I come
Because weekends were, were

It was a Thursday night and the party was bumpin'
And the bass was thumpin' and people was jumpin'
And Taboo's at the front door comin'
Taboo's at the front door comin'

And

And
Nah, nah, nah

Yo, Mr. Will.i.am
(Mr. Will.i.am)
Win or win

Get our boogie on when the weekend come
Check the peapod 'cuz the vibes is strong

Salinas Filipinas, they come one by one
All lined up, and they ready for fun
Short one's, tall one's, beautiful ones
B-boys, B-girls, ready to what

Breakin' and shakin' when we doin' our ish
J-Rock from the Beat Junkies ready to mix
'Cuz they cuttin' up the wax for everybody
Come on over 'cuz we're havin' a party

We lightin' up the sky with the burnin' star
Throw your hands in the air, if you know who you are
'Cuz we jumpin' around with the Broshigeez
And get less by the beat pharmacy 'cuz they hittin' you with

Four letters don’t gotta be stressful
Thought love was the reason we was here for
Turn around and ya’ given me an earful,
That’s a no-no, gotta go though
I meant that I actually got a so-so
Gotta mean that you gotta act loco
That’s why you callin me up on ya’ photo
Stop blowin me up on ya’ phone yo
And yo’ are stressing when I say yo’
I think you still owe me back on the low yo’
Ya’ keep blowin me up, keep blowin me up

Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why are we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision

I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse

Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one

I don't understand why it's never been done
So, let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one

I try to call again, I get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread
Apologies are often open ended
But this was better left unsaid

One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call
No need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight
We'll leave it on the line

We'll leave it on the line
Yeah, oh yeah
We'll leave it on the line, tonight",Pop

Veo sus lagrimas caer
El silencio, me hace daño
Se acabo nuestro querer
La tristeza me castiga, se apropia de mi ser

[Chorus]
Puedes llevarte mi ilusion
Romperme todo el corazon, como un cristal
Que se cae al suelo
Pero te juro que al final, sola me voy a levantar
Como un rascacielos!
Como un rascacielos!

Poco a poco, con el tiempo
Voy a olvidarme de ti
No te vas a dar cuenta, que estoy sangrando aqui
Mis ventanas se han quebrado, mas no me voy a rendir

Romperme todo el corazon, como un cristal

Vete a volar, yo estoy mejor asi
Soy lejos de ti
No vuelvas mas, que ya lo decidi
Sin tu recuerdo aprendere a vivir

Was telling everyone it's not that bad
'Til all my shit hit the fan

I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you""

I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, ""It's all your fault""
He was telling me, ""No, you're not that strong""

I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you""

Why, I, I, I, I, I, I been through hell and back

Holding on to wasted time
Gotta learn to let go in life

[Captivated]
One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes
And I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips has me so taken and I love the way you
Make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you I am so sedated
I'm captivated by you
You're just like the wind because
Everything moves when you are around it
The sun is just the sound of your voice in the morning
World up and I love the way you
Make me dance from miles away
When I am with you I am never jaded, or captivated
I never stopped believing in this crazy love we live in
Sugar hold me close and make me sweeter I need you I love you
So please show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
And dream one breath I want to fill the emptiness
I love the way you can make
Me dance from miles away
It's been so long, I waited and I am captivated

[Electric Kiss]
We are a generation twisted by a myth,
Confused and ludicrous, holding on to love. 
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst. 
Alive with all the lips we've kissed and losing all control. 
We're gonna start a resistance, 
We want independence. 
We're gonna give the world some of this: 

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips. 
One voice forever, we'll live together. 
Peace, Love, Solitude and Happiness: 
Electric Kiss.  

Fame is our felony, we're so in love with it. 
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go. 
But the poets and the fighters of our time 
Put down their weapons and their arms and know what they must do. 
They're gonna start a resistance, 
They want independence. 
They're gonna give the world some of this: 

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, We'll live together
Peace, Love, Solitude, and Happiness

Electric Kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, We'll live together
Peace, Love, Solitude, and Happiness

For better or for worse

But I know that I still need you here

Zero tre tre sette
il resto non ce l'ho
sarai molto occupato
ma poi ti troverò
non posso dir di più per non sentirmi giù
di me poi che ne sai? Io do del tu ai miei guai
un punto fisso tu su cui non giro più
resto in linea che fame ho
ora aggancio e poi precipito.
Ma poi basterà un tuo respiro
il vortice sai se ne va

326,Camilla Cabello,,"Waking again, don't know why
It's far too still tonight round my bed shadows fall
Thinking of you, where you are
And how I got this far wondering when you might call

Tired and so alone, I ignore the TV drone
Every heart beat turns toward the telephone

You're in my mind, in my dreams
I'm cursed or so it seems don't know where to take flight
Always the same old doubt and it turns me inside out
It's so hard to walk away try as I might

'Cause I'm broken inside pieces of me, intense and obscene
Forced not to show the things that I know
All of the flaws I keep unseen
I turn to you, what else can I do
Hoping to find a way to see through a break in sky,
To get through the night discover the peace I wish I knew

Painting in shades of grey
Sifting through the disarray
Can I find enough of me to make you stay?

'Cause I'm broken inside
Pieces of me, intense and obscene
Forced not to show the things that I know all of the flaws I keep unseen
I turn to you, what else can I do
Hoping to find a way to see through a break in sky,
To get through the night discover the peace I wish I knew

But you, you turn the tide wash over me, come set me free
I won't question why or try to disguise all of the things you mean to me
I'll trust in you, what else can I do
I can't deny something so true
Look at me now, wondering how I'll keep the peace I found with you",Pop

To get away from your parents
And I thought: ""Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair
But I thought: ""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cutting class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were living in
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

I kept on seeing him look at me while he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Do you see her?
She's so short and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing ""Summertime Sadness""?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first
Let me take a selfie

Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever
How about ""Livin' with my bitches, hash tag LIVE""
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes

Do you think I should take it down?

Let me take another selfie

Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers

OK, let's go take some shots

4 years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner

From your roommate back in Boulder

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song

You got it, but I won't
Give it up, shorty
Step it up, for me

I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date, when
You got close my heart would just stop
Thought me and you together would end up on top, you
Changed me for better for worse
I know I was caught up always put you first, I
Never once thought you would be triflin
But oh I was blinded...

I was like (oh oh oh)
Never wanna let you (go go go)
I was open before (had me open before)
But now I know...
Love made me blind so I can't see
All the lies you told
Were right in front of me
Since love made me blind
You made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect
When it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking to much but
I'm good glad that I know now
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has it's reasons
Every smile has it's own season
Never once thought you'd be triflin
But oh I was blinded...

Never wanna let you (go go go)

Though the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
And I know you're beautiful lying
Cause love made me blind

Love made me blind so I can't see

 Much more than a Grammy award
 That's how much you mean to me

 You could be my it girl
 Baby you're the shhh girl
 Lovin' you could be a crime
 Crazy how we fit girl
 This is it girl

 Knockin' them dead
 Dropping like flies around you
 If I get your body close not letting go
 Hoping you're about to
 Tell them other guys they can lose your number
 You're done!
 They don't get another shot cause you're...love drunk
 Like a TV show playing reruns
 Every chance I get

Queen of hearts*
Queen of hearts.
She the type of girl to make ya lazy.
Don't wanna do a thing.
I've been thinking crazy lately;
Like buying her a ring.
I used to be at the party with ladies, getting down.
I used to play with them girls
But, I'm thinking different now.

Oooooh she's a star;
She makes me fly.
Takin' me places, I've never seen.
Two worlds apart.
But, she don't mind,
Cause she's got her wings.

I ain't the only one in love,
Reputation is a bad girl;
Cause she the queen of hearts.
She had me open from the start,
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards.
Shorty’s the queen of hearts.
Queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shawty the queen of hearts (Ooh ooooh oooh)
Shawty ’s the queen of hearts.

Can't wait to wake up in the morning,
Knowing she'll be around.
Heaven shoulda sent a warning;
Before sending me an angel down.
I used to chase all the money, the cars, and all them broads.
But, I don't care for them thangs ever since she stole my heart.

Oooooh she's a star;
She makes me fly.
Takin' me places, I've never seen.
Two worlds apart.
But, she don't mind,
Cause she's got her wings.

I ain't the only one in love,
Reputation is a bad girl;
Cause she the queen of hearts.
She had me open from the start,
Having had her I wish I dealt the cards.

I met her at a bar*
The look she gave me said I wouldn't get far
But that ain't never stop me
See I like a challenge so I proceeded to speak
One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover
Love hangover, love hangover

Don't you worry it's fine
See this will be our little dirty secret for life
Cause your man will lose his mind
If he ever found out last night

One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover

Now I didn't know
How far it'll go
But I said I would have her
Now it's the morning after

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in

Like smoke in my arms
You just disappear
One moment your here

Are you really there?

One touch not enough,
Wanna dance with chu all night
But you keep me n keep me in the half line

Your running again,
Like those in a race,
Is it love that you want?
Or just the thrill of the chase,
One moment your here,
Then you flash away,
Let's just start again,

See like your doing me wrong,

It let me know you feel the same
I can hold you
Keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worry
Cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we’re used to
No other way to say
I need you everyday
And now I’m gonna change my ways
And it’s part of you I never wanna lose
I’d do anything you want me to
Like any other day
I know I’ll find a way
And if ever I’m alone, you say

I’ll be thinking about you
I’ll be thinking about you
I’ll be thinking about you
I’ll be thinking about you

In a moment
I know that everything can change
And I know that
My life will never be the same
You’re the only one that’s making sense to me
When I close my eyes you’re the one I see
There’s no other way
I can ever be without you babe

Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we’re used to
No other way to say

And now I’m gonna change my ways
And it’s a part of you I never wanna lose

I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love [?] what made you strong
I pray to god, I just don't know anymore

When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down anything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you

Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it?
I been breakin up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin'
I got more liquor, more ladies, more drugs and no cases
Witch house and no babies
I hope no phone saving and if so you gon hate me

Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
Thats just a couple more problems
To add to the couples' counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]
Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are old me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal

If I told you, that this couldn't get better baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worried, cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do, is all for loving you
Its not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you, I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone you'll say

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

In a moment, I know that everything could change
And I know that, my life would never be the same
You're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes, you're the one, I see
There's no other way I could ever be
Without you babe

Now everything I do, is all for loving you
Its not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you, I never wanna lose

Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
But we know that we're brave enough to be

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Break through from the other side
And lead me to paradise
Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
And every time I close my eyes we disappear

Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit baby, I'm a little camera shy

You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you 'to my west coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, tryna finish all this potion

I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside, so you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver gettin' fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks, Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russian with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of your tongue rings
She likes the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck, with gold grills
In the back room, In the VIP
She don’t ever leave…

I'm addied up, added up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't flying

[Hook]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it (x4)
Baby girl, you know what I like, baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck
She don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun
Take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, you can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time investment
Them fall shows every year like a birthday
And I’mma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baby girl, you know what I like, baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like
I just passed that liquor, fell off stage
I just sold out the 02 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back on
Some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO, mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
‘Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street, nigga, making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to ""The Boy"" broke bread on tour
Man, it’s all love now
Shout out my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Man he popping more bottles then us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow

Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some choppers on the car
What kind of caps I got the finest of them all
Somebody pop em before we pop em all, before we pop em all

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

Mama I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
Where it goin', no telling
But to make room, I'll vanish
Call a friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexis
I let my niggas test it
I'm always worth a cent
Best believe I'm already spent
My blunt full of BC
My cup full of Texas
Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask ""who's next?""

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need

Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration

For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you ain't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you ain't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you ain't gotta check the sky

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all

Is to meet my boys

Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes
off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
Thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending

Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out

From loneliness
And why are you squeezing my hand
So tightly
And your thoughts seem to be wandering?
I love you so much
Why?
Don't be so hard-headed
Stop doubting me
Although in the future there's a large sky
I'm not afraid

Don't love me because you think I'm different

Don't love me because I know what a lie it would be

Because it's my destiny
Because I can't change

This great love deserves to soar through the blue sky

Love Don't Cost A Thing (Video Version)
Hello?
Hi!
Your not gonna be able to make it?....again.
No, uh yeah I got it. Actually I was just opening it. It's beautiful. I just wish that you could've been here instead of a braclet. K? Cuz the last thing I need is another braclet. *click*

You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 

When you rolled up in, the Esclade
Saw the dub you gave, to vale
Knew that it was game, when you looked at me
Pullin up your sleeve so I could see the Rolly bling
Saw you later in, the corner booth
Raisin up a toast, so I would notice you
But your hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're ballin out of control

All that matter's is
You said you'd treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 

When I took a chance 
Thought you'd understand 
Baby credit cards aren't romance 
So you're tryna buy what's already yours 
What I need from is not available in stores 
Seen a side of you that I really feel 
Doing way too much, never keep it real 
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road 
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? 
I've got to go 

All that matter's is
You said you'd treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing, thing, thing

*Dance Break*

You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
(love don't cost a thing!)
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
(benz, i don't)
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
(got my own)
Even if you were broke 
(Even if you were broke, my love don't cost a thing!)
My love don't cost a thing 

You think you gotta keep me iced 
(iced, you don't)
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
(a thing!)
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
(think i wanna)
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
(if I wanna)
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing, thing, thing

You think the money that you make 
(that you make)
Can substitute the time you take 
(time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart 
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart 
I think you need to take some time 
To show me that your love is true 
There's more than dollar signs in you 
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart 
You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't 
You think I'm gonna spend your cash 
I won't 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz 
I don't 
If I wanna floss I got my own 
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing

You think you gotta keep me iced 
You don't

500,Jennifer Lopez,,"Like a movie scene, in the sweetest dreams
I had pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

I'm Gonna Be Alright (Nas Remix)
                (feat. Nas)
[Jennifer Lopez & (Nas)]
Oh yes (Uh, this for you girl)

[Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cars in yo hand
All I know is Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Jennifer Lopez]
Money, cars for a while
Walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me ""This ain't right""
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say

[Chorus]
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

[Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
Saw the way you were from the start
Cause I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez & {Nas}]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be leaving without you (Leaving without you) {Huh, this life is crazy}
So now it's time for me to make that move

[Nas with J.Lo ad-libs]
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap Stephen King, rock bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright
But it's like you feelin' lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard
Writin' me and my boys
We start fights, with will I'm in charge
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught

[Chorus]",Pop
502,Jennifer Lopez,,"Love is life
And life is living
It's very special

Ohh
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah yeah

It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreating me
And it's crazy, but, oh, baby
It don't matter whatever don't faze me

I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce baby
Let's talk about this, man

Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah
Time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I've waited up for you
Oh, boy
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now, come here

Stop playing, you gaming
I got to leave you alone

'Cause I'm good
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah
Time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

People make mistakes, to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely
And chill baby, you know me, you love me, I'm like your homie
Instead of beefing come hold me, I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
Nothin' will ever be the same so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now

And there's no more to explain to me, you know
I know you're game I'm not feelin' what you do
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah yeah

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have

CORO

Piensas que me tienes en control

El amor que te doy se paga con amor
Todo para ti tiene un valor
Mira de una vez soy como soy
El amor que te doy se paga con amor

VERSO 1

Tu llegaste alli y como un rey
En la discoteque me gustaste
Me senti volar al mirarme asi
Tu sonrisa me basto para llegar a mi
Para impresionar, estabas tu
Junto a los demas brindando un champagne
Con tu vanidad y ese ??? ???
En tu mundo te sentias como el mejor

Hook

Y si asi tomaras de lo que me das
El amor que siento no se puede comprar yeah

CORO

VERSO 2

Tu me quieres dar todo material
Pero te falto, el romance
Para que comprar, lo que es tuyo ya
Lo que busco, en la tienda no se vende
Yo te pido mas, y no me lo das
Necesito amor algo mas real
Si no puede ser ven y dimelo
Ya no puedo un dia mas entiendelo

Y si asi tomaras de lo que me das

Se paga con amor, amor, amor
No hay un millon ni mucho mas (mucho mas)
Que ami me pueda conquistar (conquistar)

Just trusting that I'm loving it

I can't refuse an offer
So benevolent
Can't assume he's gonna use me

This thing movin' too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant

But it's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in

He's scared of bein' hurt again

Let go of your heart

Got a little smoke, got a little drinks sending me happy
Got a little dubs wit my hands up hunnies feelin' me
Got that crystal on ice like a gangsta lean
Passed around and I'm nice like security
After party in the Ritz countin' house suite
All my thugs n' me rest men are like cannot see

 Ven a celebrar
 Sigue tu deseo de bailar

Straight from the hood
You've always been there for me

And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yaa

Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue phantoms and stretch may backs
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet

When pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real true story

Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cuz baby you don't have to change no

We got chedda, I'm twice as rich
Make you bite your lips, Jenny, you know you like unless
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists
Treat you like a bitch, never that

We got beef where my niggaz at
Streets is where I'm living at

Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack
Where we at, uptown where it's really at
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop
Let my hands slip a knot

Joe you the don, Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way

I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of my fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no

Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother

Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real
Shut up your grill, you know we never fight

If You Had My Love (Dark Child Remix)
(Rodney Jerkins): 
C'mon and just dance a little 
Let me see you dance a little 
I like it when you dance a little 
Baby work it out just dance a little 

(Jennifer Lopez): 
Now if I give you me this is how it's got to be 
First of all I won't take your cheating on me 
And who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 

You said that we could possibly 
Spend eternity, see that's what you told me 
That's what you told me 
Well if you want me 
You have to be fulfilling of my needs 
If you really want me baby 

If you had my love 
And I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew 
That your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me 
And call me baby 

You said you want my love 
And you got to have it all 
But first there are some things you need to know 
If you wanna live with all I have to give 
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah 

I don't want you to get with me 
And I get my heart hurt, please 
I don't need the hurt, I don't need the pain 
So before I do, give myself to you 
I have to know the truth 
If I spend my life with you 

Repeat Chorus (2x)

Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiabamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada

Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero

Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma

Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

MaÃ±ana que amanezca un dia nuevo en mi universo
MaÃ±ana no verÃ© tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escucharÃ© palabras de arrepentimiento
IgnorarÃ© sin pena tu remordimiento

MaÃ±ana olvidarÃ© que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
MaÃ±ana ni siquiera habrÃ¡ razones para odiarte
Yo borrarÃ© todos tus sueÃ±os de mis sueÃ±os

wasting Crumbling like pastries
And they screamThe worst things in life come free to us
‘Cos we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, rain coat Tried to
swim and stay afloat Dry house, wet clothes Loose change, bank notes

Weary-eyed, dry throat Call girl, no phone And they say

Covered in white, closed eyed
And hoping for a better life This time will fade out tonight

She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away

Yeah is she out is she out there
Yeah is she out there
Cause you're all that I need

In every single way
Girl you got me lip syncing
Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted
I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name
Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams

Thought that true love was actually real
Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
Cause I want you in the worst of ways can you make my wish come true
Is she out there is she out there
Just tell me if you're out there if you're out there

Feel like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Ohh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah I should have shut my stupid mouth

The long table
The boomerang
Travelling way down south

It straight to your face

If I didn't say it first

Drinking up my loneliness down till 2 AM
No no more waiting, pacing round the bar

To hear the thunder and the rain

To wash away the pain
Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere

Wanna go with you anywhere

I'm sorry i kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you
But these tangerine dreams will not go away

Build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just keep me company

Suffering silently

Heal The World
spoken:
Think about the generations and to say we want to make it a better
world for our children and our children's children. So that they know
it's a better world for them; and think if they can make it a better
place.


There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow.
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.


If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving.
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world, make a better world.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race.
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.

Bridge:
And the dream we would conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify it's soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be God's glow.


We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn
Their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space to make a better place.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.

Refrain (2x)


There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.

You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children

Kicking dirt in my eye

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stenches in the air
The funk of forty thousand years

Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their need?

And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know?

There are some with no home, not a nickel to loan

And a washed out dream

And it shows that we are needing in there
Then I read the headlines
And it said they're dying there
And it showed that we was heeding a stand

There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day

Give them your heart
And you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can't feed them all

And it said that children die
And it shows that soon can we work hard

Dangerous
The way she came into the palce
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
And left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of lvoe
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
And said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

I cannot sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

She's so dsngerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
but you're no damn good for me

Your love is magical, that's how I feel

Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain 
To tell you how I feel 
But I am speechless, speechless 
That's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say My head's 
spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray Helpless and hopeless, that's 
how I feel inside Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side 
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found It's as though I 
am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground Speechless, speechless, 
that's how you make me feel Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is

I guess u could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd u like 2 waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me 2 her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started 2 grind

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell u what she did 2 me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show u no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff, sho'nuff show u how 2 grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank u 4 a funky time
Call me up whenever u want 2 grind

Come back Nikki, come back

Nothing Compares To You
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues,

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

It's been so lonely without u here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely rage
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said rossie u better have fun
No matter what u do
Cause it's the blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

All the flowers that u planted 
In the back yard suga
All died when u went away

Seems that I was busy doing something close too nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

And the horses wonder who you are

To get through this thing called life
Electric word life it means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld, a world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left?
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld
This life you're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you at least you got friends
Come on lady for friendly word
She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
Ahh, ahh is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go

All excited but we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do, what's it all for
Better live now before the grim reaper
Come knocking on your door

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go

Come on baby let's get nuts
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go, go crazy

About a woman u already know
No, prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy control
(Are u ready?)

Ah, pussy control, oh
Ah, pussy control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in

One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded all y'alls molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step

And step she did to the straight as
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
Know, why?

So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said mama didn't tell 'em what she told me
Girl, u need pussy control
(Are u ready?)

Ah, pussy control, oh
Ah, pussy control, oh

Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love pussy never did fall

And this fool named trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more chick than a bic
'Bout how he gonna make pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit

Pussy said nigga, u crazy if u don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
U can go platinum 4 times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week

So push up on somebody wanna hear that
'Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
Boy, u better act like u understand
When u roll with pussy control

Ah, pussy control, oh
Ah, pussy control, oh

I need another piece of your ear
I wanna hip u all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year

'Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the club international balls
She was rollin 4 deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul

I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here

I fear you're lonely and u want to know
A 12'o clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're pussy control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be

But it's gonna be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want 2 sell, sell, sell

Can I tell u what I'm thinkin' that u already know?
U need a motherfucker that respects your name
Now say it, pussy control

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make 'em act like they know
You are, was and always will be pussy control

I've heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I've carried you
Through the bridal path door

And ever since that day I haven't wanted, anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth, that I

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

I heard a voice on the news saying
People want to stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people â€~round my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name

I've never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false

That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name

I love it when you call my name
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name",Pop

591,Prince,,"I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down

And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe
Well, that's all I'm living for, yeah

Didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running

I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh lover, yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you

And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild

I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running

I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah",Pop
592,Prince,,"All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

And I saw an Angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet
  (1 2 3 4 - 1 2 3 4)
But behold, we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright
(That's alright)
4 I will watch them fall
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
(Just how old)

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now
You and me will still be here, we will still be here

There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a there will be no death for with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

Just how old
Just how old
Just how old",Pop
593,Prince,,"Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Baby, baby, baby
Is it him or is it me?

Don't make me
Waste my time
Don't make me
Lose my mind, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Whole day, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right?

You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones
They hurt you, every time

Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life, a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always, every time

If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh baby, baby, baby
If we get married
Would that be cool?

You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose
Baby, baby, baby

So, what's it gonna be, baby?
Do you want him?
Or do you want me?
'Cuz I want you
Said I want you

Tell me baby
Do you want me?
I gotta know, I gotta know
Do you want me?

Baby, baby, baby
Listen to me
I may not know
Where I'm going, baby
I said, I may not know
What I need

One thing, one thing's
For certain baby
I know what I want, yeah

And it's to please you baby
Please you baby
I'm bendin' down on my knees
I want you, yes, I do

I want you, yes I do",Pop
