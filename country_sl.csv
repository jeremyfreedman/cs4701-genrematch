I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
'Til you walked into my life

It was a feelin'
I'd never known
And for the first time
I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have

And I still tremble
When we touch
And oh, the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend

You're more than a lover

To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer

3,Tim McGraw,http://www.songlyrics.com/tim-mcgraw/my-next-thirty-years-lyrics/,"I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord, have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey, my next thirty years, I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years, I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here in my next thirty years

Oh, my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years",Country

My Little Girl
Verse 1:
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go.
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know.
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm.
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born.

Chorus:
Beautiful baby from the outside in.
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again.
Go on, take on this whole world.
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl.

Verse 2:
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone.
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown.
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door.
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy Love You More!"".

(Repeat Chorus)

Verse 3:
Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand.
But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know, he's the half
that makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man.
I know he'll say that he's in love.
But between you and me. He won't be good enough!

Let's Make Love (with Tim McGraw)



(Chris Lindsey, Marv Green, Bill Luther, Aimee Mayo)

Baby I've been drifting away
Dreaming all day
Of holidng you
Touching you
The only thing I want to do
Is be with you
As close to you
As I can be

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby

Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you
I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes
Let’s get lost tonight
In each other

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Oh, until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Oh baby, let's make love
All night long
All night long
Let’s make love",Country
6,Tim McGraw,http://www.songlyrics.com/tim-mcgraw/just-to-see-you-smile-lyrics/,"You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no

Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost, just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Only leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost, just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to

7,Tim McGraw,http://www.songlyrics.com/tim-mcgraw/whiskey-and-you-lyrics/,"There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And its empty so right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor and I'll be over it by noon
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk into a store
It ain't a problem, yeah, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness is something I can't buy, ain't a thing that I can do
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

One's a devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
The one's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
One's a long, hard, bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink 'cause I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
If I don't break down and bring it on myself, it will hit right out of the blue
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

One's a devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long, hard, bitter truth

I was tryin' not to go too far
Kept thinkin' 'bout the words
The preacher man said

Lightnin' flashed across the sky
I saw love in a young girl's eyes
And that's a look you never forget

Seventeen, only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby

Seventeen, livin' on crazy dreams
Rock and Roll and faded blue jeans
And standin' on the edge of everythin'
Seventeen

Legs hangin' off the Bayou Bridge
Feedin' fish potato chips
And talkin' about the mysteries
Of the universe

Yeah, the world was somewhere else
We had the summer all to ourselves
And the stars went off like fireworks

Seventeen, only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by wild and free
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby

Seventeen, livin' on crazy dreams
Rock and Roll and faded blue jeans
And standin' on the edge of everythin'
Seventeen

Seventeen, only comes once in a lifetime
Well, don't it just fly by wild and free
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby

I wanna smoke that cigarette
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath

I wanna ride across West Virginia
In the back seat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that

So I need you like a needle needs a vein
Like my uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs rain
I need you like a lighthouse on a coast
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost
I need you

I wanna get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I wanna dance to the static of an AM radio

I wanna wrap the moon around us
Lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up
'Til the sun goes down again

'Cause I need you like a needle needs a vein
Like my uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain
I need you like a lighthouse on a coast

I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

In that open field out on the edge of town

In that open field out on the edge of town

I just never could quite tell you no

Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done, I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
â€~Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done, I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done, I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost just to see you smile",Country

Up there in your high society

My mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am

But baby, I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride

When it comes to lovin' you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I'll take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
Except to do the best I can
I'll be damned

Would there be a street parade?
Would I just be an afterthought?

Could I fly around like Superman?
Would I make the Sunday paper?

I wonder who I'd see cryin' standin' over me
And who would just send their regards
Would anybody say, ""At least he's in a better place""?
And who would get this old guitar?

If I died today, would my mama keep on prayin'?
Would my buddies go out drinkin'?
Would my alarm clock keep on blinkin'?

And if I died today, would I need to be ashamed?
Would I be easy to forget?
Could I live with my regrets?

I wonder who I'd see cryin' standin' over me

Would anybody say the world will never be the same?

Would my family talk about me
Every Christmas and Thanksgivin'?

And Ronnie with his two kids, how 'bout that wife he's got
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby

I got a call in Alabama, said, ""Come on home to Louisiana""
And come as fast as you can fly 'cause your momma really needs you

Slips on her gown, takes a look outside

With coffee and flowers
He walks toward the door
And as he says good morning
Her jaw falls to the floor

Now we all take chances
Every once in a while
We take chances
If it's just to ease our minds

We all take chances
Wrong or right
Ah, but sometimes chances
Take us by surprise

Yeah, sometimes chances
Take us by surprise",Country
36,Blake Shelton,http://www.songlyrics.com/blake-shelton/ol-red-lyrics/,"Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em let Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out",Country

Miscellaneous
A Father's Love
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn’t matter why
When Dad got home I told that story just like I’d rehearsed
Then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

And he said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen”

When I became a father in the spring of ‘81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father’s son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy’s secret and I passed it on to him

And I said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
I said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen”

Last night I dreamed I’d died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the stuff I done they’ll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again

And they said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see daddies don’t just love their children every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen”",Country

Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way

Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst

And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""

When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him

I said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
I said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""

Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I''ve done, they'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again

And they said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""",Country

Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time

'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of this page
I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your 'frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words
Long after we're gone

Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

Sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
She gets mad that they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'

I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand

And I still don't know why
So, here's to you and whoever
Holds my baby blue tonight

Friends In Low Places (Long Version)
Blame it all on my roots 
I showed up in boots 
And ruined your black tie affair 
The last one to know 
The last one to show 
I was the last one you thought you'd see there 
And I saw the surprise 
And the fear in his eyes 
When I took his glass of champagne 
And I toasted you 
Said ""Honey we may be through 
But you'll never hear me complain"" 
'Cause I've got friends in low places 
Where the whiskey drowns 
And the beer chases my blues away 
And I'll be okay 
I'm not big on social graces 
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis 
Oh, I've got friends in low places 
(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK) 
Well I guess I was wrong 
I just don't belong 
But then, I've been there before 
Everything's alright 
I'll just say goodnight 
And I'll show myself to the door 
Hey, I didn't mean 
To cause a big scene 
Just give me an hour and then 
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower 
That you're livin' in 
'Cause I've got friends in low places 
Where the whiskey drowns 
And the beer chases my blues away 
And I'll be okay 
I'm not big on social graces 
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis 
Oh, I've got friends in low places 
EVERYBODY! 
I've got friends in low places 
Where the whiskey drowns 
And the beer chases my blues away 
And I'll be okay 
I'm not big on social graces

Oh, I've got friends in low places 
(SPOKEN) 
(Pause) 
What?!?! 
(Pause) 
You guys... already know what's comin', don't ya? 
And ya know what... you're right. 
You're exactly right. What would a Garth Live album 
be without the live version of Friends In Low Places? 
Because it's only here where you can find that 
mysterious third verse that goes on the end of that 
song. But, does anybody know the words to that 
verse? That's what I wanna know. 
Well, in that case I think the friends in low places 
should sing that third verse. 
This outta be good. 
Alright, here we go...

Well I guess I was wrong

To cause a big scene 
Just wait till I finish this glass 
And sweet little lady 
I'll head back to the bar 
GIVE IT TO ME!!! 
And you can kiss my ass!

The dance we shared 'neath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye?

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall

If Tomorrow Never Comes
Sometimes late at night 
I lie awake and watch her sleeping 
She's lost in peaceful dreams 
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark 
And the thought crosses my mind 
If I never wake up in the morning 
Would she ever doubt the way I feel 
About her in my heart 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 
Who never knew how much I loved them 
Now I live with the regret 
That my true feelings for them never were revealed 
So I made a promise to myself 
To say each day how much she means to me 
And avoid that circumstance 
Where there's no second chance 
To tell her how I feel 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
So tell that someone that you love 
Just what you're thinking of 
If tomorrow never comes",Country

Shameless
Well I'm shameless
When it comes to loving you,
I'll do anything you want me to,
I'll do anything at all.

And I'm standing
Here for all the world to see,
Oh, baby that's what's left of me,
I don't have very far to fall.

You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in.
I don't break easy, I have my pride,
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless.
Honey, I don't have a prayer.
Every time I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees.

And I'm changing,
Swore I'd never compromise,
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise.
I'll do anything you need.

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down.
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,
But I can't walk away from you.

I have never had anything have this much control on me.
I've worked too hard to call my life my own.
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,
But it sure won't now, I can't refuse,
I've never had so much to lose.
And I'm shameless...

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong.
I've never lost anything I ever missed,
But I've never been in love like this.
It's out of my hands.

I'm shameless.
I don't have the power now,
And I don't want it anyhow,
So I gotta let it go.

And I'm shameless.
Shameless as a man can be.
You could make a total fool of me.
I just wanted you to know
That I'm shameless.",Country

That Summer
I went to work for her that summer 
A teenage kid so far from home 
She was a lonely widow woman 
Hell bent to make it on her own 
We were a thousand miles from nowhere 
Wheat fields as far as I could see 
Both needing something from each other 
Not knowing yet what that might be 
'Til she came to me one evening 
Hot cup of coffee and a smile 
In a dress that I was certain 
She hadn't worn in quite a while 
There was a difference in her laughter 
There was a softness in her eyes 
And on the air there was a hunger 
Even a boy could recognize 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
That summer wind was all around me 
Nothing between us but the night 
When I told her that I'd never 
She softly whispered ""That's alright"" 
And then I watched her hands of leather 
Turn to velvet in a touch 
There's never been amother summer 
When I have ever loved as much 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
I often think about that summer 
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace 
And I have rarely held another 
When I haven't seen her face 
And every time I pass a wheat field 
And watch it dancing with the wind 
Although I know it isn't real 
I swear inside I feel 
Her hungry arms again 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
Rushing in long in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burnin' both ends of the night",Country

The Thunder Rolls (Long Version)
Three thirty in the morning 
Not a soul in sight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night 
Raindrops on the windshield 
There's a storm moving in 
He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he never should have been 
The thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night 
The thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 
She's waiting by the window 
When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him 
Thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain 
A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightning flashes in her eyes 
And he knows that she knows 
The thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 
She runs back down the hallway 
And through the bedroom door 
She reaches for the pistol 
Kept in the dresser drawer 
Tells the lady in mirror 
He won't do this again 
'Cause tonight will be the last time 
She'll wonder where he's been 
The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold, darlin'

And let the waters slip away 
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow 
It has now become today 
So don't you sit upon the shoreline 
And say you're satisfied 
Choose to chance the rapids 
And dare to dance that tide 
And I will sail my vessel 
'Til the river runs dry 
Like a bird upon the wind 
These waters are my sky 
I'll never reach my destination 
If I never try 
So I will sail my vessel 
'Til the river runs dry

And I know I'll tke soome falls 
With the good Lord as my captain 
I can make it through them all 
And I will sail my vessel 
'Til the river runs dry

Standing Outside The Fire
We call them cool 
Those hearts that have no scars to show 
The ones that never do let go 
And risk it the tables being turned 

We call them fools 
Who have to dance within the flame 
Who chance the sorrow and the shame 
That always come with getting burned 

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire 
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire 
We call them strong 
Those who can face this world alone 
Who seem to get by on their own 
Those who will never take the fall 

We call them weak 
Who are unable to resist 
The slightest chance love might exist 
And for that forsake it all 

They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire 
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire 

Chorus: 
Standing outside the fire 
Standing outside the fire 
Life is not tried it is merely survived 
If you're standing outside the fire 

There's this love that is burning 
Deep in my soul 
Constantly yearning to get out of control 
Wanting to fly hiher and higher 
I can't abide standing outside the fire

89,Garth Brooks,http://www.songlyrics.com/garth-brooks/garth-brooks-christmas-the-gift-lyrics/,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for to rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay

A few moments passed till she saw it
For its feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the town folks brought presents
To lay by the manger that night

There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
""Maria what brings you to me?
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see""

Though she trembled, she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",Country

Unanswered Prayers
Just the other night at a hometown football game 
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame 
And as I introduced them the past came back to me 
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be 

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times 
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine 
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then 
I'd never ask for anything again 

CHORUS: 
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers 
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs 
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care 
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers 

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams 
And I could tell that time had changed me 
In her eyes too it seemed 
We tried to talk about the old days 
There wasn't much we could recall 
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all 

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife 
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord 
For the gifts in my life

Mama was a looker 
Lord, how she shined 
Papa was a good'n 
But the jealous kind 
Papa loved Mama 
Mama loved men 
Mama's in the graveyard 
Papa's in the pen 
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did 
Papa came home and it was just us kids 
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine 
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine 
I heard him cry for Mama up and own the hall 
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall 
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound 
When Papa fired it up and headed into town 
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well 
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel 
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear 
He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears 
Mama was a looker 
Lord, how she shined 
Papa was a good'n 
But the jealous kind 
Papa loved Mama

His wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels

She knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles

The gold in the buckle

It's cowboy hats

It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing, rodeo

When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall

And it's so long, girl, I'll see you

It's the ropes and the reins

It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive the man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play the game

And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo

Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles

And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings

Now, I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam

When You Come Back To Me Again
There's a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea. 
It's been tossed about, lost and broken wondering aimlessly. 
And God somehow you know that ship is me. 
Cause theres a light house, in a harbor shining faithfully, 
pouring its life out across the water, 
for this sinking soul in the sea. 
That someone out there still believes in me. 

On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice, 
and it keeps me hanging on. 
Ohhhh, raining down, against the wind, 
I'm reaching out, till we reach the cirlces end, 
when you come back to me again. 

Theres a moment, that we all come to, 
in our own time, in our own space, 
and all that we've done, 
we can undo if our hearts in the right place. 

On a prayer, in a song, 
I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on. 
Ohhhh, raining down, against the wind, 
I'm reaching out, till we reach the circles end, 
when you come back to me again and again 
I see my yesterdays in front of me, 
unfolding like a mystery, 
your changing all that is and used to be. 

On a prayer, in a song, 
I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on.

Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)

This ol' highway's getting longer 
Seems there ain't no end in sight 
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest 
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night 

I called the house but no one answered 
For the last two weeks no one's been home 
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see 
What's kept the woman holding on this long 

And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 

The competition's getting younger 
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall 
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze 
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all 

And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old

The Cowboy Song

Pushin horns weren't easy like the movie said it was 
And I don't recall no dance hall girls 
Or hotel rooms with rugs 
You worked hot and tired and nasty 
Rode your pony's head too low 
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep 
'Cause it was too damn cold 
And you'd sing ""Strawberry Roan"" and ""Little Joe"" 
Like the time we hit the river 
And the rains began to fall 
And the water was risin' so damn fast 
We thought it'd drown us all 
We lost a lot of steers that day 
And four to five good mounts 
But when all the boys rode into camp 
We knew that's what counts 
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and ""Amazing Grace"" 
Or the night they broke behind us 
And then took us by surprise 
I whistled out to Bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes 
And he rode for all his horse would ride 
And I know he done his best 
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Dunny to his death 
And we sang ""Bringing in the Sheaves"" and ""The Rugged Cross"" 
So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice 
He never meant to bow them legs 
Or put that gravel in his voice 
He's just chasin' what he really loves 
And what's burnin' in his soul 
Wishin' to God that he'd benn born a hundred years ago 
Still singin' ""Strawberry Roan"" and ""Little Joe""",Country

Belleau Wood
Oh the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper 
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No' heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Country

And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been

For when it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

She's so unpredictable

Rolling through the motions every day

Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I'm still enough?

Give you everything that that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

But a perfect simple kind of loving?

There was a time our love ran wild and free

Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees

My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
We'll I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

The only deer I've seen's been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
'Cause ain't no boss callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck but it's been a good day

And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate

I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah, things got out of hand at that party
I said, ""That's it, it's 'bout time I grow up""

Chuggin' sink water, staring at the wall
Trying to put the pieces back together again

Jumped in and broke up a fight

Think I took a kiss a little too far
Who's that sleeping on my couch

Big copperheads and mean wild pigs,
And gators in the weeds waitin' for ya.

I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind,
I pull my hat down low,
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hair
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - thump thump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song.
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I get my feet in that Muckalee creek water.

Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a crawfish basket.
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits.

I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' lines
Countin' cash and stockin' beers

So in the meantime, think on this

I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Bean
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems

I've seen girls like you in here before

Hit the steak house, make-out in the movies
Way up in the back

To make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothing new

she woke up fighting mad
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around,
I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind,
ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time,
oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on a radio station,
won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita,
fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how this now just seems to come in when
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Well I've been on a hell of a redneck road for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation

And he broke her down and when I'm around I can see it in her smile
She's fighting getting closer, it's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready, but that's alright with me

She started calling me baby, and two years later I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said I'm your man and Girl will you marry me?

She said, you know that I'm ready, and I have been for a while
And the bells sound and you turn around, I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer, it's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready, so that's alright with me

That's alright with me",Country

With a heavy load
And now my high beams are shining on my babies road
Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires
Have ourselves a hell of a night
Look up in that Carolina sky
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine
It's been a long time
Since we felt that creek
Running cold and clear over our bare feet
Baby you don't know that this right here
Is the same water my home man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say
It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul
Well get you a sip
And let the whiskey take control
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time

Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""

In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice

Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed

When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

Turning into moms and dads

Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead

Like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first""

You can't flip it over and start again

Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother

There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Well last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me

I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother

There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh, we went out last night

My life hung on what that tear meant

Make me laugh
Make me smile

Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it

Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends
And that apartment got smaller everyday

Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, she said where have you been
You used to call and tell me you're on your way

She said if this is how it's gonna be then I quit
She walked out the door and I lost it

A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
So simple yet experimental
Innocent but still a little wild child

Tube socks, Jesus sandals
Cheap blender, ice bucket
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it

Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri
And laughs, here's to the boys at the factory

No more building transmissions
He's going deep sea fishing
Catch a marlin, catch a tan
Catch a local cover band

Hey, you gotta watch that man
He'll go coastal on ya

Silver hair, silver Buick
Winter's coming, better move it
Southbound before they get snowed under
Call the kids, tell 'em see you next summer

No more freezing their tails off
It's cataract sunglasses and a round of golf
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track
Before you know it Mom and Dad
They'll go coastal on ya

Sounds so good, got me thinking
What do y'all say after I'm done singing

We just take a little getaway
Cruise it down the A1A
Florabama to the Keys
Better keep your eye on me

I'll go coastal on ya
I'll go coastal on ya

Over by the gate Lordy, here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea

I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain't a foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chuggin' along

She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on

She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weeny ride before I take her home

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chuggin' along

She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

Well she ain't into cars or pick up trucks
But if it runs like a Deere man, her eyes light up

She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me

Something in your voice called me, turned my head
Your smile, just captured me
You were in my future as far as I could see
And I dont know how it happens, but it happens still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will

Well you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

Inside I built a wall
So high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall
One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time I'd let someone in",Country

Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up
But who knows where to start

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul

I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

Which road I travel

So weak and tired I could barely stand
From bein' up all night praying she'd say, ""Yes""

So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death
My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me, and I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it

Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends
And that apartment got smaller everyday

Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, she said, ""Where have you been
You used to call and tell me you're on your way""
She said, ""If this is how it's gonna be then I quit""
She walked out the door, I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it

I picked myself up off the floor
She walked back through the door
We made love like it was the first time

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure

I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake

Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me

And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist

It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me

And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
But don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright

While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather

In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and all your reasons

'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

Come on, turn it up, yeah
Start living your life on the double
Leave your troubles behind
You and me, we're gonna be alright

Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you're gonna fly with me

And you could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain, just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're gonna fly with me

Well, here we are, baby, in the back of my bed
Suns going down, sky's turning red
Stars coming out, baby, look at you now

God knows how long but it's been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby, I could get used to this

Now that you've shown me who I really am

And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes

Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more
I wanna be your everything

When you wake up, I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out for me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
And I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost

I need you and who knows where just friends ends
When you cross that line and love begins
In over my head and the water's turnin' blue

But what would I do without you
What would I do without you

Hearts never know the way they want to go and want to stay
We need two but in time you find the road
And though inside you know you've gotta go
The hardest part I find is you're all I ever knew

But what will I do without you
What will I do without you

I gotta break these habit chains I put on me
And be all that I can be, try and find what I need
Memories suspend in time, all the days when you were mine
And the chance I took to move, one I thought I'd never do

But I made it through without you
I made it through without you

From what would I do without you
To I made it through without you, without you

Smoke and mirrors
Somebody stole you away
That's the biggest conspiracy
Since, JFK

So we combed the corners
And glass houses

We never found it

Just the mere reflection of your face
For one shining moment

The cops and the CIA
They drew chalk circles 'round
The place that we used to lay

But nobody testified
Not a single witness
I swore, I was crucified
With no forgiveness

And the sheriff shined his light
Like I was drunk and dangerous
My hands were already tied
So he put away his handcuffs

And in my blind spot
I saw the silhouette
Your crazy legs smoking
A long black cigarette

But I'd trade in all the rest of my days
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways
I'd fill up all this empty space

With you or somebody like you
With you or somebody just like you

Done what I was told
Should've counted all my blessings

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way",Country

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide

A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""

Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go

201,Johnny Cash,http://www.songlyrics.com/johnny-cash/one-piece-at-a-time-lyrics/,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit workin' on a assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of 'most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

I'd get it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adaptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight that was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, ""Honey, take me for a spin""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds

I'd got it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round

Ah yeah Red Ryder this is the cottonmouth
In the pshycho Billy, Cadillac, come on
Ah, this is the cottonmouth a negatory
On the cost of this mow-chine there Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ah! What model is it?

Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58, 59 automobile

And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you're gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

What could I do? Yeah what could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that name",Country

205,Johnny Cash,http://www.songlyrics.com/johnny-cash/cocaine-blues-lyrics/,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Well, Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""

Said, ""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more""

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff comin' down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty heck into that district court""

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holdin' the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground

206,Johnny Cash,http://www.songlyrics.com/johnny-cash/the-christmas-guest-lyrics/,"It happened one day at December's end
Two neighbors called on an old time friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green

And Old Conrad was sitting with face a shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said, ""My friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me""
And He said, ""I'm coming your guest to be""

""So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fir
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined""

And now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and I'll look on His face

Then his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day

But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start

And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision that he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn

But Old Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, ""Your feet must be cold and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too""

So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the dear Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait

Then he heard another knock and he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
And a bundle of kindling piled on her back

But she asked only for a place to rest
A place that was reserved for Conrad's great Guest
But her voice seemed to plead, ""Don't send me away
Let me rest for a-while, it's Christmas Day""

So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
And after she had left, he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away

And the Lord had not come as He said He would
And Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
â€½Please help me and tell me where am I?""

So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day

Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he could make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears

Then he led her back to her home once more
Then as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had all passed away

So he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
And he said, ""Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
I wanted so much your face to seeâ€

Then softly in the silence a voice he heard
""Lift up your head, I have kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
Three times I came to your lonely door""

""I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
I was honored to be your Christmas guest""",Country

Goin By The Book

There's gonna be a battle the lines have been drawn
They've got guns and tanks and planes

The wells are gone dry and the water is bad and the air is acid rain
There's war after war and rumors of war from the East
There's a rumblin' in the ground and they're talkin' about the beast

Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high
With the blood of too many sons
Some people say peace is on the way
But the worst is still to come

Cause the prophets wrote about it
And Jesus spoke about it
And John got to take a look
And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see
It's goin' by the book
It's goin' by the book

There's armies in the cities and the missiles stand ready for flight
A pale horse rides like the wind across the night

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who is long paid for his crime

I wear the black for those who've never read

About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man In Black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all were on their side

And things need changin' everywhere you go

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was the true love of mine

See for me if her hair's hanging down
It curls and flows all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hanging down
That's the way I remember her best

If you go when the snowflakes fall
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

And if you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there

She was once a true love of mine",Country
216,Johnny Cash,http://www.songlyrics.com/johnny-cash/foolish-questions-lyrics/,"Now you've all heard foolish questions and no doubt you've wondered why
Some person will ask a foolish question and expect a sensible reply
Like when you take your girl some candy, say maybe just after tea
You notice how she'll grab it and then she'll say, ""Is this for me?""

Foolish questions, you can answer when you can
""No, I bought this candy for your Ma or Pa, or for John, the hired hand
I just thought you'd like to see it, now I'm gonna take it away""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day

And then most every morning, there is someone `round the place
Who sees you take the shaving brush and lather up your face
And as you give the razor a preliminary wave
This fool will walk up and ask you, ""Are you gonna take a shave?""

Foolish questions, your answer is I hope
""No, I ain't prepared for shavin', I just like the taste of soap
I kinda like to take the shaving brush and paint myself this way""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day

Now then there's this fella who meets you on your way
And asks you why your all dressed up and listens while you say
That you just been returning from the funeral of poor old Uncle Ned
As soon as you have told him, he will say, ""Is Ned dead?""

Foolish questions, you might as well reply
""No, he thought he'd have the funeral now, then later on he'd die
You know Ned was always so original, he wanted it that way""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day

Now suppose the elevator guy should forget to close the door
And you should tumble down, oh say forty-seven floors
And when you reach the bottom and you're lying there inert
Some fool will stick his head down the shaft and holler, ""Are you hurt?""

Foolish questions, your dying words are
""No, I was in an awful hurry and that elevator's just too slow
Usually saves a lot of time you know, comin' down this way""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day
That was a foolish question, you'll hear 'em ev'ry day",Country

And we'd count our many blessings one by one

I can see us sittin' 'round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me

This old world of ours is filled with troubles
But this old world would oh so better be

Damage I cannot undo

It makes you that much stronger

Some chances I just threw away
Some roads, I never should've taken

Been some signs I shouldn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some roads that I wish I could have one more chance to make

Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
The way, you know, just what I mean

No, I can't learn to live without
Oh, so don't you give up on us now

Oh, I know I could say we're through and tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Oh, and I don't wanna try

Oh, I know I could say we're through and tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
I just can't live a lie

Never feel
Left all alone

Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones

And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road

I'm on my way

Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
Well I'm on my way

So many romantic dreams
Up in lights, fallin' off
The silver screen

My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams

I'm on my way
I'm on my way

Just set me free

Slides up behind her and holds on tight

Why does it have to end?""

Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge

They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Ooh, a tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm he says
""Come on baby, lets get outta here""
They take one last drive around town
And man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says

Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through

I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you",Country

Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stop light town
And back when I was really young
Part of that burned down
On any given Friday night
We'd drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the grocery store
Laugin' all the while
With as many friends as I could pack
In my Daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house
I'd rather be tippin' cows in Tulsa
Than hailin' cabs here in New York
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue sky
The Oklahoma kind

In a world of long red carpets
The bright lights of Hollywood
All the paparazzi flashin'
Can make a girl feel pretty good
You can get anything you want here
Except a Walmart store
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide,
It makes me feel small sometimes,
I miss the big blue skies,
the Oklahoma kind

Where the Wildcats beat Iron Heads
Old settler's day and the Okra fest
After prom down at the bowlin' lanes
Catchin' crape fish in Eufaula Lake
I ain't in Checotah anymore.

I'm in a world so wide,
It makes me feel small sometimes,
I miss the big blue skies,

But I ain't in Checotah,
No I ain't in Checotah,
Oh, there's nothing like Oklahoma.

And I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes

Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands

Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is

When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me

You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is

It's a life time thrill when tiding braces
The biggest things in the smallest places

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is

To pack my bags and leave before

Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek

I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well, word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end

Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know
That today is a day of a reckoning

Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

Well, she lit up the sky that 4th of July
By the time the fireman come
They just put out the flames
And took down some names
And sent me to the county home

Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know
That today is a day of a reckoning

Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
On Independence Day, roll the stone away

Making Love Out of Nothing at All
I know just how to whisper, and I know just how to cry 
I know just where to find the answers and I know just how to lie 
And I know the night is fading, and I know the times gonna fly 
And I'll never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you 
but I know I gotta give it a try 
But I don't know how to leave you, and I'll never let you fall 
And I don't know how you do it 
Making love, out of nothing at all....... 

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost 
And it's looking for a rhythm like you 
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night, 
and turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright 

I gotta follow it, cause everything I know 
well It's nothing till I give it to you

To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid

Broken and bruised, wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on
Trying to get back home
Through the struggles and the troubles I know we don't walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed

God keep us safe, safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid

Behind These Hazel Eyes
""Behind These Hazel Eyes""

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

With a note that said, ""I'll love her till I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything

She's 'I want a piece of chocolate'
'Take me to a movie'
She's 'I can't find a thing to wear'
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing

She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday

She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother

She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's the voice I love to hear
And someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me

Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me

I said, ""I put one back behind the bar, I bet it's probably yours""

There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment, there was never any doubt
I had found the one that I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin', when she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt

And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

And you're a big old wuss if you don't jump in the water

And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks, ice up that old Igloo
And drive until the map turns blue

Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed with water

Let her go boys

And when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

You can stay right there when the daylight's gone
Play truth or dare, and it won't take long

To play tuba in the Rose Parade

Sun sets about nine, this time of year
Oh we can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck and we might just get stuck

The red flag on my chest somehow is like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn but from my point of view

I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday
And caught between southern pride and southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood
Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

I'm just a white man

Comin' to you from the southland

Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from

But not everything we've done

It ain't like you and me can re-write history

She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listenin' to the Beatles singin' ""Back in the USSR""

She's just goin' to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair

And it's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight

Just another American Saturday night

There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie
They got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like we're all livin' in a big ol' cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up

It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight

Just another American Saturday night

You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great-great-great-granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this

You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy and Chinatown sittin' there side by side
Live from New York

Spanish moss in the moonlight

Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm okay

And said, ""You see that thing right there, well you know what that means""

I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me

He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearin' something in a cast
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street

He's gonna get in trouble, oh he's gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me

I can see him right now, knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass tryin' to melt the Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on?
That'll be his first love 'til his first love comes along

He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me

He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket, he'll pay for mowing grass
He's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a week

He's gonna get into trouble, we're gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me

He's gonna love me and hate me along the way
Years are gonna fly by and I already dread the day

He's gonna hug his momma, he's gonna shake my hand
He's gonna act like he can't wait to leave

He sat down in his overalls and asked me
""You waitin' on a woman?""
I nodded, yeah and said, ""How 'bout you""
He said, ""Son since nineteen fifty-two
I've been waitin' on a woman""

""And when I picked her up for our first date
I told her, I'd be there at eight""
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said, ""I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on""
But let me tell you son, she sure looked pretty

Yeah, she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
And waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, ""I'll say this 'bout the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman""

And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy, it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it

She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any

I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind

Where they hit it hard till the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care that we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everyone else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don’t quit till the job gets done

That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop till everything’s gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don’t back up, don’t back down
Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

That old red dirt the first thing you learn
You don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
Didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop till everything’s gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Don’t back up, don’t back down

Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more

You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires.
Muscadine wine

[Chorus:]
Oh baby you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin’ ‘round watchin’ all these pretty things.
Get down in that Georgia clay.
And I’ll find peace.
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
I'm chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
It’s my kinda party.

[Verse 2:]
If you wanna drink,
Go baby just do your thing.
Give up your keys.
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire.
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside.
Gotcha sippin' on some moonshine.
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo,
You can be my tan-legged Juliet,
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo.

[Repeat Chorus (2x):]

Ya'll ready for this?
Ya'll gonna turn it on up.",Country

A small town Friday night
Revving up at a red light
On your mark, get set, go

Past a mom and pop restaurant
Same four trucks parked out front
I guess you gotta make your own fun
When you're stuck in a place this slow

There's only two means of salvation around here
That seem to work
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

I'm like that A-M station
That never comes in right
'Til you pass the city limit sign
That's the only time it all gets clear

Well, it's crystal clear
That I just need to find
A place where there is no lines
And nothing like it is around here

Someplace where it don't feel like
This world revolves around
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

Here it sometimes feels
Just like this world revolves around
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

Well, I need to get out
Of this church pew or bar stool kind of town

It knocks you down just like it should

Something about this time feels different 
It's like I'm in a fight I'm about to loose

It just keeps picking on me 
And this might be the tears that keep on falling 
They won't stop falling on down 
They won't stop raining on down 
And baby it's to early to know for certain 
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

But it never works it only makes it worse 
So tonight I'm here again throwing punches in the wind 
At some memory that i cant even see 
I know that I don't want to let it have me 
But everytime it hits i feel the truth 

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

And this might be the tears that keep on falling 
They wont stop falling on down 
They wont stop raining on down 
And baby its to early to know for certain 
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting 

Tomorrow ill stand up again 
and give it my best shot again

That hangs over the river, I still got the scares
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallowed ground

Lived and learned a lotta stuff
It's everything we're made of

It sure left its mark on us
We sure left our mark on it

Ain't what it used to be at all

Seeing you smile at me is all that I recall

I still can't remember why we said goodbye

Maybe time's just playing tricks
On me these days
Or maybe these old feelings
Never went away

'Cause all that I remember
Is I'm still in love with you
And if I'm losing my mind
I hope you are too

Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again…

We're living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee

And diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holding on

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer

He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask why
But please don't let my dream to run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo sky""

Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on

Way back in the pines
Or work for the mayor
Down in the mine

Your first day in the hole
There's a pit in your stomach
And your mouth's full of coal

There's no turnin' back
Once you make up your mind
As the cart rattles on
Down in the mine

Your tears turn to mud
And you can't catch your breath
For the dust in your lungs

Where the sun never shines
Twelve hours a day
And diggin' your grave
Way down in the mine

Well, the old-towners talk
But you just don't believe
It can all go to hell
At two thousand feet

Life sways in the bounds
Of nature and time
And fate has no mercy
Down in the mine

The news spread like fire
And burned through those hills
Hopes were held high
But five men got killed

On the wings of canaries
They'll so surely fly
While their bones spend eternity
Down in the mines

Your tears turn to mud
And you can't catch your breath
For the dust in your lungs

And a pool of moonshine

You pretended you weren't home

Won't you come on outside tonight?
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day

Hey, what do you say?
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground?
Hell, won't you come on down?
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around

Can't you hear the banjos
Ringin' through the air?
There'll be mandolins
And guitars everywhere
And don't you wanna be there?

The light's up on Coverte
Are you tryin' to drive me crazy, babe
Or did you just forget?

The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the Old Rugged Cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach, gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

And I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down

And exchange it some day for a crown

I just came down from Chippewa*
Had as station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I’d lost a year before
I hadn’t seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by when your memory came flooding in and you closed that door.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I’ve been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.

Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.

It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
It was 2nd hand, from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her

We put on a shine, put on a border
Built out of love, but made for the water
We ran her for years, 'til the transim got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson, an electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel

And I would turn her sharp and I would make it wide
He'd say, ""You can't be the way, an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line""
But I was king of the ocean when Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton, short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it ridin' 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going

He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
On a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of thick pin road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel

And I would press that clutch and I would keep it right
He'd say, ""Just a little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a little dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti when Daddy let me drive

I'm all grown up now, 3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory and think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old four doors, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel

And he'd say, ""Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl, now you're doing just fine""
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain when Daddy let me drive
Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt

Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts

Remember when the sound of little feet was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give up

Remember when

Remember when thirty something seemed old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again

Funny you should ask that

What country am I in?

Yes sir.

Choose the words that cut like a razor

Down deep as a diamond mine,
She is my treasure so very rare,
She made me a millionaire,
When we ride around,
Ride around this old town in my beat up car
With the windows down,
People look at her and they look at me
And say, ""That boy is sure living in luxury; sweet luxury"".
Because love is more precious than gold,
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold,
I've got love, enough to share,
That makes me a millionaire,

When the kids are far from everywhere,
Life reaches on,
A millionaire,
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare,

Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow

And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river

Well the readhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river

I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood

When The Stars Come OutChris Stapleton

I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me

And I got a feeling tonight might be the night

I think of the memories that time can’t erase
And all of the smiles that you’ve brought to my face
You’re love’s been so true

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I leave this earth you’ll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you’ll be there
And I’ll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You’re heaven to me

It makes me want more of you",Country

Daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore

[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn’t get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I’d hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God’s word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn’t make a sound
This afternoon we’ll lay him in the ground
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore",Country

When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear, we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years, you've never let me down
You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you, through the years
I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, who I listened to before
I swear, you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me, I need you more and more

Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you, through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belong
Right here with you, through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you
Through the years

Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found

It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away

I met up with the gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life, out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table

On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over

I sat down and asked her name
When the drink finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams

I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever
The other life brings

In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watch him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman

Who sat their beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain

For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin'
His big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille
Four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived thru' some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all

She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'coz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille
Four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived thru' some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille

I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand

There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky an' there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all

Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end

I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through

Just odds and ends I fashioned with my heart and with my hands

And the phrases that I rhyme are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you Reuben James

Reuben James, all the folks around Madison County cussed your name
You're just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who'd steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Flora Grey, the gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name Reuben James

Reuben James, with your mind on my soul
And a Bible in your right hand you said, ""Turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek""
In my mind these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James one dark cloudy day they brought you from the field
Until your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher and me in the rain
Just to sing one last refrain for Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James",Country

You never looked better than tonight

I was so sure that this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay

Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Ho, put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye

Now it's morning and the phone rings and ya say
You gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what I was thinking girl, I'd turn around
If you'd just ask me one more time

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again

Three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

""Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life""

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if, she'd say

""Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life""

And the more that he lives, the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives, the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
'Cause, I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life, rest of your life

You can call to raise
Or you can check and fold 'em

Dallas Cowboy football on TV

And raised on the banks of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing about fallin' in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all comin' but her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast, you know what I mean
The way a girl gets when she turns seventeen, kinda crazy

She's a rebel child and a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time they caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

She holds tight, me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there preachin' to the choir, you see
God love her
Oh, me and God love her!

She kissed her mama goodbye, said I'll be sure 'n phone ya
She called her from a truck stop in Tucson Arizona
With Amazing Grace, we made California line

And then my gypsy life started takin' its toll
And the fast lane got empty and out of control
And just like an angel she saved my soul from the devil

Yeah, she's a rebel child and a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time they caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

She holds tight, me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there, preachin' to the choir, you see
God love her
Oh, me and God love her!

Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle

Son a man had to answer for the wicked that he'd done
Take all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak tree
Round up all of them bad boys, hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line

And we'll all meet back at the local saloon

We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singin'
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doin' dirty deeds
Too much corruption and crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down
You can bet he'll set 'em down

Had everything I own
In the saddles on my back

I had a reputation
For never stayin' very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they laid the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town

She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yeah

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And that fire in her eyes

That makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table
And the bullets in the gun, yeah

She was sittin' on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up who owned the bar
In a Cadillac Deville

Grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her in the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack

Tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
If you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes

That makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run

Down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes?

We came to a town
With a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens
And the sound of runnin' feet
There were 50 Federales
Locked and loaded in the street

She grabbed my 44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat poundin'
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded

She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air, yeah

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And that fire in her eyes

Heart To Heart
I watched him throw his oatmeal bowl
Halfway across the kitchen floor
His momma said don't let me see you do that anymore

And he let loose with a cup of orange juice
Right down the back of her dress
Without a doubt she lined him out
Then cleaned up the mess

Now he is just a chip off of the old block
Just like me we keep her on her toes a lot

But when he cries she'll match him tear for tear
When he laughs she'll grin from ear to ear
When he's wrong they'll stand there face to face
She can put him in his place
Side by side and hand in hand
She'll talk with daddy's little man
He knows that she's done her part
I'm watching God's love grow
Heart to heart

He'll grow to be six foot three
Yeah he's gonna be just like me
He'll be tall and play football

I saw a flashing neon, up ahead
It looked like a place to find some satisfaction

I paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
Drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen to a word he said
I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action

Little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off at a corner table
She had a longneck bottle, she was peeling the label
The look on her face it was perfectly clear
She said, ""Somebody please get me out of here""
The look she shot me through the glass refraction

If Santa made it, so they can say
""Look what he brought me!""

Sleigh bells are ringing in their heads
Twisting like little tops in their beds
Trying to sleep but it's no use
With hooves tap-tappin' on the roof

Peeking out the window to see what they can see
It's a candy cane Christmas, sweet as it can be
It's a candy cane Christmas, sweet as it can be",Country

Fifth time I've said I'm sorry
The sun slowly peaking through the glass
Says we been up all night

We both know where this is going
It's been a long time coming
Is it really over?
Is this really goodbye?

Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe
Buy a little more time

But I got nothin'
No magic words
To stop your leavin'
To end this hurt

I'm just blank
I'm staring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
'Cause I got nothin'

I watch you pack your things
You look down at your ring
You slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed

Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need

But I got nothin'
No magic words
To stop your leavin'
To end this hurt

And you stop and turn around
Your eyes are begging me
Please say something right now

To stop your leavin'

Can we make up just to break up our lives
It will be the last night that we spend let’s not fight

So before you go don’t say no no no

Can we make up just to break up our lives

Girl can you let me know, just let me know, before you go if you’d Rather be with me
I’ll make it alright just for the night
Just let me feel you let me hear you

On her big toe, tattooed in Myrtle Beach

Got a suitcase full of beads

She's walked on fire
And jumped out of planes for fun

I fly and fall
Till I unravel at the seams

She never played it safe
Never walked when she could run

To a sleepy southern town
Gave up a sweet gig to have a couple kids
Chasing her around

All her friends roll their eyes and grin
When she says that I'm the one
They say loving me is the craziest thing

Dancing on a ledge

Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gath'ring
And the storm will wreck our home
For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching
From the window up above

You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But I guess it's best to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching
From the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love

And wake up to an honest love

The secret of a happiness
but some of them never learn

The secret i'm speaking of
Well it's a woman and a man in love
and the answer is in this song
that i always sing

Grand Tour, The



Written by G. Richey, C. Taylor & N. Wilson 

Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she brang the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper oh I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Just like she left them when she tore my world apart

And I don't like my work
But I don't mind the money at all

I see lots of sad faces
And lots of bad cases
Of folks with their backs to the wall

I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away

I can light up your smokes
I can laugh at your jokes
I can watch you fall down on your knees

I can close down this bar
Go and gas up my old car
I can pack up, oh Lord, and mail in the key

I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away

Now the smoke fills the air in this honky-tonk bar
And I'm thinking 'bout where I'd rather be
But I burned all my bridges and I sank all ships
Now I'm stranded at the edge of the sea

I still need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray

When The Grass Grows Over Me



by Don Chapel 

When you left I thought that I would soon be over you
Even told myself that I would find somebody new
Time and tears have come and gone but not your memory
But I'll be over you when the grass grows over me

(Chorus:)
Yes I'll be over you when you're standing over me
And as you look down at the cold cold ground I'm sleeping in
Don't expect to hear me say that I still love you then
'Cause I'll be over you when the grass grows over me

Even when my eyes are closed they keep on seeing you
Every minute of the night I'm hurting through and through
And as long as I'm alive I know I can't be free
But I'll be over you when the grass grows over me

(Repeat chorus)",Country

She couldn't read the music, just the words
But when she'd stand to sing on Sunday mornin'
She had the sweetest voice I think I've, I've ever heard

She loved to sing the songs about our Savior
""There is a Fountain,"" was her favorite one
And I've seen tears roll down the cheeks of sinners
By the time my mama's song was done

When mama sang the angels stopped to listen
You could see the love light shinin' in her face
When mama sang the angels stopped to listen
Now in Heaven's choir she has a special place

You know my daddy wanted me to sing a song
The day that mama left us
And you know that little church was filled with all of mama's friends
And you know it seemed that we could all hear mama singin'
When I couldn't finish her, her favorite hymn

These Days
I woke up this morning aching with pain
DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢t think I can work, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢ll try
The carÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s in the shop so I thumbed all the way

I walked home from work and it rained all the way
My wife left and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢t say why
She laid all her bills on the desk in the hall
Oh these days I barely get by

Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose and I cried
Oh, my boss says come winter weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢ll all be laid off
Oh these days I barely get by

The Party's Over (1967)

Let’s call it a night the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

What a crazy, crazy party never seen so many people
Laughing dancing look at you you're having fun
But look at me I'm almost crying but that don't keep her love from dying
Misery calls for me the party's over

Life for me was just one party and then another
Had to have my party wine I broke her heart so many times
And then one night she said, ""Sweetheart the party's over""

My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys (1980)
I grew up dreaming of being a cowboy and loving the cowboy ways
Pursuing the life of my high riding heroes I burned up my childhood days
I learned all the rules of a modern day drifter don’t you hold on to nothing too long
Just take what you need from the ladies and leave them with the words of a sad country song

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are it seems
Sadly in search of and one-step in back of
Themselves and their slow moving dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery from being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare knowing well that your best days are gone
Picking up hookers instead of my pen I let the words of my youth fade away
Old worn out saddles and old worm out memories with no one and no place to stay

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are it seems
Sadly in search of and one-step in back of
Themselves and their slow moving dreams

Last night you came home late and I knew you'd been drinking by that old mellow look on your face

City Of New Orleans (1984)
Riding on the city of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty five sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passing towns that have no name and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America how are you
Say don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels grumbling neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes a sleep rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rail is all they feel

Good morning America how are you
Say don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning
Thru the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again the passengers will please refrain
This trains got the disappearing railroad blues

All the Federales, they say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Poncho bit down South
Ended up in Lefty's mouth

The day they lay poor Poncho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

All the Federales they say
We could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

The poets tell how Poncho fell
And Lefty's livin' in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told

Poncho needs your prayers, it's true
Save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old

All the Federales, they say
We could have had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

A few gray Federales, they say
Could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose",Country

Maybe somewhere in the middle of the night
I might not be thinking anything at all
When a perfect stranger's face catches a certain light

And my heart jumps 'cause all at once
There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, as lovely as you'll always be
And here I go back into those memories
Where you are still in love with me

I know I'll never hold you in my arms again
I know I'll never hear you speak my name
I look around this lonely room and I can see
Your memory's the only thing that hasn't changed

And I close my eyes and every time
There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, as lovely as you'll always be
And here I go back into those memories

Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night

Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so

While you through my window peep

And you never shut your eye

Forgiving You Is Easy (1985)
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
I just keep thinking, and your memory is forever on my mind
You know I’ll always love you and I can’t forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time

The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh what a heartache, but I forgive the things you said to me
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I’ll find peace of mind
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time

The years has passed so quickly as once again they steal a young man’s dreams
Of the golden years and growing old together you and me
You asked me to forgive you; you said there was another on your mind
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time",Country

But these hand prints on the front steps are mine

Up those stairs in that little back bedroom

And I bet you didn't know under that live oak

This brokenness inside me might start healing

If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
And nail by nail and board by board

'Cause every last one, route one, rural heart's
Got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows it just a little too well

Whether you're late for church
Or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Everybody dies famous in a small town",Country

You laying with her in our bed
Love can be a tragedy when you do what you did to me
All I'm seeing now is red

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Bible told me to forget all those who trespass against
Tread their feet on sacred ground
Bad things come with consequence what feels good hurts in the end
Don't wanna think about that now

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury them baby, all of our sins
Hear the thunder six feet under
Hit your knees, won't do it again

Guilty pleasure ease the pain
Whiskey running through my veins
Too late to save you now

I need to repent
A sin for a sin

Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury them baby, all of our sins

Hit your knees, won't do it again

Makes you look cool and feel like a man

Me and your cigarettes

Started young, it's too late to quit
Most call it a bad bad habit
Your mama told you you could end up dead with me
Me and your cigarettes

Always there every time you need me
It ain't love, it's just like nicotine
You're addicted to a feeling you can only get
From me and your cigarettes

Light us up and then throw us down
Walk away when we hit the ground
How's it gonna feel when you come back around here and see
It's just you and your cigarettes

To kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong

And as I'm putting out the flame
Somebody brings up your name

Oh oh oh oh
Baby baby baby, bring me down
I wanna be right where you are
Baby baby baby, bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart

Laughs out loud at my trusting heart
If like I didn't see the penny
I missed the fountain by a couple yards

You would only stay gone
Maybe I could move on

I wanna be right where you are

Miscellaneous
Somebody Else
Highway 65 sure sounds kinda nice
I feel like driving somewhere far away
I’ve got the top rolled down
The radio way up loud
Playing Willie and old Hank
I don’t really have a certain destination
I’ll just fill the gas tank up
And use my imagination

I wanna feel my freedom blowing through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind
And scream out I don’t care
I’m tired of being down and out
Cause that ain’t what life should be about
I can feel the load get lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

Sometimes we’re afraid to change
Scared of what tomorrow brings
Same routine everyday
If you never stop and listen
You won’t know what you’ll be missing
Let your life slip away

I wanna feel my freedom blowing through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind
And scream out I don’t care
I’m tired of being down and out
Cause that ain’t what life should be about
I can feel the load get lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

I wanna feel my freedom blowing through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind
And scream out I don’t care
I’m tired of being down and out
Cause that ain’t what life should be about
I can feel the load get lighter with every mile

I wanna be somebody else for a little while",Country

You're just waiting for somebody to pick you up again

All you ever wanted was a silent place to grow

Pretty little thing, sometimes you gotta look up

'Cause the way you hang your head nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell, my Virginia Bluebell

Even through the snow a flower can bloom
You just need a little push, spring is coming soon
Umbrella in the rain, let it roll off your back
Weather what you can, realize what you have

Pretty little thing, sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see all the beauty that you're made of
'Cause the way you hang your head nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell

Put a little light in the darkest places
Put a little smile on the saddest faces

Homemade curtains lit just like a gypsy
Break her heart and roll out of town
'Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled or tethered in tide
The safety of the fence
Or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a light houses with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
Or save me on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more

Homemade curtains lit just like a gypsy",Country
521,Miranda Lambert,http://www.songlyrics.com/miranda-lambert/me-and-charlie-talking-lyrics/,"Me and Charlie boy used to go walking
Sittin' in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss
And holding hands with nobody else around

Charlie said, ""He wanted to get married ""
But we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said, ""We'd never let our love run dry
Like so many do these days""

So we treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off

Oh promises we made when we go walkin'
And that's just me and Charlie talking

Charlie always said, ""He'd like to live here""
Turned eighteen and left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting
For Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found

It's funny how time and distance change you
The road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions
Then you look up and it's gone

So you treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine but for a little while
You catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off

Oh promises we made when we go walking
That's just me and Charlie talking

Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie
How we thought we new it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love
From a child's heart again

So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off

Oh promises we made when we go walking

 Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
 I'm gonna let you go and walk away 
 Like every day I said I would
 And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
 To that voice of reason inside my head Telling me that we're no good

 But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
 Rock you strong in these arms of mine
 Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
 We're like fire and gasoline
 I'm no good for you
 You're no good for me
 We only bring each other tears and sorrow
 But tonight, I'm gonna live you like there's no tomorrow

 [Verse 2]
 Tomorrow I'll be stronger
 I'm not gonna break down and call you up When my heart cries out for you
 And tomorrow, You won't believe it
 But, when I pass your house
 I won't stop, No matter how bad I want to

 Baby when we're good, You know we're great
 But there's too much bad for us to think That there's anything worth trying to save

And every nightmare when you sleep
Waits patiently by your door

So they try to him me through them contracts

Yea the boy wonder they boy gunner
I stay fresh to death had the other boys under pressure
They had to step they gear up
If not they knew not to go near her

'Cause she never messed with lames
She messed with older guys that messed with Caine
We was the younger dudes up next in the game
But she was young and dumb so she cared less of the game

You know that game and the same old song
Now I ride around hearin' them bitches playin' my song
I tried to tell them its gon' be my turn
Now they tryin' help an keep my sperm
  (Ah motherfuckers yea)

It's okay I'm still young anyway I can last all night
We can hump any day I got chunks put away
And some chunk on the way used the pump where I laid
Now its pumps where I lay chumps wanna play we backin' them down

Thats what you get for approaching with out askin' around
You know we get our toaster with out pattin' us down
It's the ROC bitch holla get your ass on the pound
Let me show you how I do how a man can get down

Got to keep my sheets clean lay that ass on the ground
Think it's all just rap let me arch that back
You ain't got to be shy baby toss that back
And most of these stories ain't worth the doe

I can't relate to commercial flows
I'm from the hood ain't nothing all good but you worthless hoe
But you work for these hoes
  (Ah motherfuckers yea)

I was broke gettin' doe from hoes
Gettin' doe gettin' doe from hoes
Grown men drownin' hold your nose stop
Falling through these chickenheads

And focus little more on your business here
You ain't radio you dudes is lames
We bringin' the painto the game you dudes radio
And most of y'all one hit wonders

The ones who done a little number shit one hit done it
Your career was an accident, I ain't scared ill blast you bitch
And get the cash to get out or buy a nice lawyer
Get a high price lawyer

I'll be out soon as the judge see my status shit
You motherfuckers gon' be mad as shit
Once the young gunnas drop, yeah the youngest from the ROC
Just what Dame needed did a couple of futures

Did the mixtapes and got the game heated
The same little nigg' niggaz from the block
Talk they shit about the ROC and you just was a fan
Before I got Jay just was your man
Now you dislike us cause you ain't in our plans

I understand keep doing what you keep doing
Give up or you'll be givin' up a hell of a chance
You niggaz bullshit with rap if you want
And I'll be laid back [Incomprehensible]

Her beauty cut just like a knife
And he was a banker from Macon
He swore he'd love her all a his life

He bought her a mansion on the mountain
With a formal garden and a lot of land
But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man

Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, ""I would walk through hell on Sunday
To keep my rose in paradise""

He hired a man to tend the garden
And keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say the gardener left alone

Now the banker is an old man
And the mansion's crumbling down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found

Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, ""I would walk through hell on Sunday
To keep my rose in paradise""

Now there's a rose out in the garden
It's beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night",Country

From her blond hair to her painted toes

And you can take it from someone who knows

It all starts with a drink and a slow dance
Oh, and if lovin' her's a part of your plan
Don't hang around with that woman
Unless you can go three rounds with her man

Aw, he's big and he's mean and he'll arrive on the scene
With bloody murder in his eyes, listen guys
Hidden somewhere in her purse or in her pocket
Is a band of gold that should be on her hand
So don't hang around with that woman
Unless you can go three rounds with her man

Aw, he's big and he's mean and he'll arrive on the scene
With bloody murder in his eyes, listen guys
This story doesn't have a happy ending
And there'll be hell to pay when this song hits the fan

And hold you close to me

So many lover's games
I'd love to play with you
On that hand there's no reason
Why it's wrong

There's a golden band
To remind me of someone
Who would not understand
On one hand I could stay

And be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go
Is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion
I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes
I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips
I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl
You're somethin' else

He said he was a cowboy when he was young
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun
And my momma's daddy was his oldest son
And I thought that he walked on water

If the story is told only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo
And though his wings, they were never seen
I thought that he walked on water

He tied a cord to the end of a mop
Said, ""Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

He was ninety years old in ' 63

â€½Well you can take that for what it's worthâ€
If it's something I can see or something I can touch
Well I might believe in all that stuff
So I just had to say to him

Are you telling me you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by
No robe of white, no halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes

And then I said ""Who went through the pain
And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth?""
She counted your fingers and toes and thank God you were whole
Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right

And who always came running every time you cried out
And how many more things have you forgotten about
And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right
And how many nights did she leave on the light
While she waited and prayed that you came in
And who'd be there for you right up to the end think about it tonight

Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by

Miscellaneous
I Told You So
(Randy Travis)

Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I loved you
And suppose I said ""I wanna come back home"".
And suppose I cried and said ""I think I finally learned my lesson""
And I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone.

If I told you that I realised you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:

""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours to and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours 
The way we did when our love first began?

Would you tell me that you'd missed me too and that you'd been so lonely
And you waited for the day that I return.
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

Would you say:

""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".

I crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home

Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty and the stars they sometimes fall

So I have to sing a song about all the things I knew

Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

From the backroads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
An' this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river

He said, ""That's one thing I'll never do""
Mama never gave up she said, ""One day

I can still hear mama softly talking
Her tears falling on her folded hands
So that Easter Sunday, Daddy walked in
That's when I began to understand

When mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away when mama prayed

Seventeen and wild I hit the bottle
Doing anything I dang well please
Burning down life's highway at full throttle
While mama burned a candle on her knees

Then one night I came home half sober
I saw mama kneeling in the den
As I listened she and Jesus talked it over
And I knew my restless days were 'bout to end

'Cause when mama prayed, good things happen
When mama prayed, lives were changed
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small crumbled all away when mama prayed

It isn't like every one of them got answered
But the times they weren't it seems to me were rare

But that dress that you're wearing says a whole 'nother thing
You laugh and you smile and you wink
Got my head spinning 'round like a roller rink
It's going places we've never been
And it's getting better with every tonic and gin
Got a Hollywood glow on your skin
Wearin' that ""I will if you will"" grin

How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor, take it too far
Out the back door, leave an open tab
When you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

How am I supposed to play it cool
With that sexy ""don't pull away"" move
I love watching you break your own rules
Come on, let me help you break a few of 'em

Now how are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor, take it too far
Out the back door, leave an open tab
When you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

Like a couple million bucks, a bombshell deluxe
Girl, you got it all together, why you messing me up?
I'm seeing you and me as the honkey tonk dream
Saying, girl, we're on a roll

And how are we not supposed to take another lap around the bar
And make a pit stop, your place, my place, any place
I wanna make it last when you look like
When you look like that, yeah
When you look like that, baby
When you look, when you look like that
You just do something to my soul, I just can't describe it
When you look like that
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now Lauren [?] and got one on the way

Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD

Sneaking in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talk about college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinking about is an unsupervised Saturday night

Buzzing off a can of the grizzly wintergreen
Looking old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm 18

I'm old enough to smoke
I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener
And I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, they're leaving me behind

What I wouldn't give to be 21, wild and free?
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world
Let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be

Woah, when I'm 21
Yeah, when I'm 21, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll be alright, when I'm 21

Like I was your guy

Takin' shots like it was nothin'

Same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people
Still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends
And the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone
Some old moonlit road

Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We could leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could

If not
I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss
Girl, just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends
And the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone
Some old moonlit road

Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We could leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could
Oh baby, you and me could
Oh baby, you and me could

Same streets
Same party

Same people

Baby, you and me can leave right now

Get to know you where it ain't so loud
