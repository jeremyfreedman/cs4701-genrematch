Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama, ooh
(Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro)
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go!

Bismillah! We will not let you go!

Will not let you go!

Will not let you go!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

2,Queen,http://www.songlyrics.com/queen/under-pressure-lyrics/,"Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming get me out
Tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Day day day
Okay

Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours

People on streets
People on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Tomorrow takes me high, high, higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Turned away from it all
Like the blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?

Love, love, love, love

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?

Give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Killer Queen
She keeps Moet et Chandon 
In her pretty cabinet 
'Let them eat cake' she says 
Just like Marie Antoinette 
A built-in remedy 
For Kruschev and Kennedy 
At anytime an invitation 
You can't decline 

Caviar and cigarettes 
Well versed in etiquette 
Extraordinarily nice 
Chorus

She's a Killer Queen 
Gunpowder, gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime 

Recommended at the price 
Insatiable an appetite 
Wanna try? 

To avoid complications 
She never kept the same address 
In conversation 
She spoke just like a baroness 
Met a man from China 
Went down to Asia Minor
Then again incidentally 
If you're that way inclined 

Perfume came naturally from Paris 
For cars she couldn't care less 
Fastidious and precise 
Chorus

Drop of a hat she's as willing as 
Playful as a pussy cat 
Then momentarily out of action 
Temporarily out of gas 
To absolutely drive you wild, wild 
She's all out to get you

The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,

There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies

The Show Must Go On (Queen)
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -

Too Much Love Will Kill You
======================================
Queen - Too Much Love Will Kill You
======================================
Words and music by Brian May, Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers

I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In me tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end.",Rock

They said, ""We made a perfect pair""
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried?

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years be lie, we lived a lie
I'll love you until' I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted all that love?

I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh

Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

So the pound has dropped and the children are creating,

Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,

Doctors on strike what you need is a rest.

Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way.

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,

And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

It isn't hard to feel me glowing-
I watched the fire that grew so low.
It is the summer of my smiles-
flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes

Ain't so hard to recognize-
These things are clear to all from

I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us...
But I know that I love you so
but I know that I love you so.
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion-

This is the mystery of the quotient-

Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.

Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.

To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.

Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man, who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men, can't see the open road

The Battle Of Evermore
Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morn - ing light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh,-------dance in the dark of night,
sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, The beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, Waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, Bring it back.
At last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes.",Rock

How you wish all your dreams would come true--Hey

I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you baby,
It's all a terrible mess

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and tas
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith


And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate


Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game


I stuck around St. Petersberg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain


I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank


Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
What's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah


I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the Gods they made


I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me


Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadors
Who get killed before they reached Bombay


Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby


Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game


Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint


So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah


Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down

Rollin' on the streets

We just needed more and more fulfilling- 
Uh-huh Time went by and it all went up in smoke
But check it out
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
Ohh I can't tell you she's the right one

It might cost a lot more than you'd think

Once you know you can never go back

Stranger things could never change my mind

I'm on a rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river
Lay me on your shore
I'll be comin' back baby

Sustaining pain to set a mood

You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome

We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights

The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons, you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Ooo, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooo, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams now
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter of the Devil himself
I've been searching for an Angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight

Ooo, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Ooo, coming right behind you

Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Holdin' you close in my dreams 
Thinkin' about all the things that we said 
And comin' apart at the seams 
We try to talk it over 
But the words come out to rough 
I know you were tryin' 
to give me the best of your love 

Beautiful faces and loud empty places 
Look at the way that we live 
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine 
Left us so little to give 
That same old crowd 
Was like a cold dark cloud 
That we could never rise above 
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love 
Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh 
Sweet darlin', you get the best of my love 

I'm goin' back in time 
And it's a sweet dream 
It was a quiet night 
And I would be all right 
If i could go on sleepin' 
But every mornin' 
I wake up and worry 
What's gonna happen today 
You see it your way 
And I see it mine 
But we both see it slippin' away 

You know we always had each other baby 
I guess that wasn't enough 
Oh, but here in my heart 
I give you the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin' 
You get the best of my love 
Oh, sweet darlin'

Where the old world shadows hang heavy in the air

She heard about a place people were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways, how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere to the great divide
Seeking a place to stand or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there
They called it paradise, I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low while the town got high

Then the chilly winds blew down across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast to the Malibu
Where the pretty people play hungry for power
To light their neon way and give them things to do

Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes and Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise, the place to be
They watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind and sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign that said, 'Jesus is coming'
Brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign

Who will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny and in the name of God

And you can see them there on Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about what it's like up there

You call some place paradise kiss it goodbye",Rock

all been washed away

inside the Sad Cafe 

Oh it seemed like a holy place 
protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud the 
things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world 
with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd 
Inside the Sad Cafe 

Oh, expecting to fly, 
we would meet on that shore in the 
sweet by and by 

Some of their dreams came true, 
some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind 
inside the Sad Cafe. 

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, 
and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some 
and let's the rest go free 

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, 
if they ever change at all

Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune

Try and Love Again
when you're up there on your own
where your memories can find you
like a circle goes around
you were lost until you found out
what it all comes down to
one by one
the lonely feelings come
day by day
they slowly fade away

ooh the look was in her eyes
you never know what might be found there
she was dancing right in time
and the moves she made so fine
like the music that surrounds her
should i stay or go
i really wanna know
would i lose or win
if i try to love again

aaah
gonna try and love again
aaaaah
i'm gonna try and love again
aaaaaah
gonna try and love

*guitar solo*

right or wrong what's done is done
it's only moments that you borrow
but the thoughts will linger on
of the lady and her song
when the sun comes up tomorrow
well it might take years
to see through all these tears
don't let go
when you find it you will know

aaaah gonna try and love again
aaaah gonna try and love again
aaaah gonna try and love again
aaaah
aaaah you sometimes lose, sometimes win, sometimes you need a friend
aaaah
aaaah
gonna try, gonna try
gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try, gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try, gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try

Please Come Home For Christmas
Bells will be ringing this sad sad New Years 
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues 
My baby's gone I have no friends 
To wish me greetings once again 
Cries will be singing Silent Night 
Christmas carols by candlelight 
Please come home for Christmas 
Please come home for Christmas 
If not for Christmas by New Years night 
Friends and relations send salutations 
Sure as the stars shine above 
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear 
The time of year to be with the ones you love 
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam 
Christmas and new Years will find you home 
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, happy once again 
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain

It's so hard to say goodbye

I can hold back my tears and try to be strong
While our love is fallin' apart
I know what I'll say if you walk away
But what do I do, what do I do with my heart?

I'm not gonna say a word
I know I can't change your mind
You know where you need to go
I know I'll be left behind

I won't hold you back, I won't stand in your way
If you need to make a new start
But I still wanna know when my arms let you go
What do I do, what do I do with my heart?

Oh, girl, don't you remember?
It was not so long ago
We were makin' plans for two
Just me and you

Now you tell me that you've found somebody
Someone who loves you better
No one could ever love you
The way I do

Tell me you're not leavin' now
Tell me that you're gonna stay
Tell me that you love me still
For this and this alone I pray

I'll do anythin' to save what we have
I'll love you 'til death do us part

And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city

He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
She said, he was ruthless, said, he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She say, ""Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red""

Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane

Eager for action, hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavily bills

There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in a race
Out every evenin' until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast line surely made you lose you mind
Life in the fast lane everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

Blowin' and burnin,' blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worse
She said, ""Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring
We've been up and down this highway
Haven't seen a goddamn thingâ€

He said, ""Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash""
The doctor say, he's comin' but you gotta pay in cash
They went rushin' down that freeway messed around and got lost
They didn't know they were just dyin' to get off and it was

Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back

They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

He had a home
Love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl

One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess, it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody, going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail

If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

In these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love

You better take a fool's advice
Take care of your own
'Cause one day they're here
Next day they're gone

Pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark

On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
He said, ""Baby, I've changed, please, come back""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
I know, the days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here

I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

of ""Go Your Own Way"".  I believe that it has been made available recently
on Fleetwood Mac's latest release -  ""The Chain"" (25 years) box set.

RHIANNON (WILL YOU EVER WIN)
Fleetwood Mac
Words and Music by Stevie Nicks

Rhiannon rings like a bell thru the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
AAnd who will be her lover?

REFRAIN: All your life you've never seen
A woman - taken by the wind
Wwould you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win.........?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
REFRAIN
rhiannon......, rhiannon......, rhiannon......
REFRAIN
-will you ever win.....?
rhiannon......rhiannon......rhiannon......
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
All your life you've never seen
A woman..taken by the wind...
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win.....?

Silver Spring
You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
You're shining on an ocean crashing
And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
But I don't want to know

I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
Tell myself you never loved me... no
And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby I don't want to know
And can you tell me was it worth it?
Really I don't want to know

But you won't forget me

Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby

Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette

Warm my mind near your gentle stove

Have you forgotten the keys to the Kingdom?
Have you been borne yet and are you alive?

Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages.
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests.
[Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war?]

We need great golden copulations.

The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
And our mother is dead in the sea.

Do you know we are being led to
Slaughters by placid admirals,
And that fat slow generals are getting
Obscene on young blood?
Do you know we are ruled by TV?

The moon is a dry blood beast.
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
In the next block of green vine,
Amassing for warfare on innocent
Herdsman who are just dying.

O great creator of being,
Grant us one more hour to perform our art
And perfect our lives.

The moths and atheists
Are doubly divine and dying.

We live, we die
And death not ends it.

Journey we more into the Nightmare.
Cling to life, our passion'd flower,
Cling to cunts and cocks of despair.
We got our final vision by clap.
Columbus' groin got
Filled with green death.

(I touched her thigh and death smiled.)

We have assembled inside this
Ancient and insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets.

The barns are stormed,
The windows kept,
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
With the divine mockery of words.
Music inflames temperament.

Are allowed to roam free,
A thousand Magicians arise in the land.)

Where is the wine,

Can you show me where it hurts?

a distant ship smoke on the horizon

My hands fell just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling again
I can't explain you would not understand

This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!

But you may feel a little sick
can you stand up?
I do believe its working good
that I'll keep you going through the show

Come on its time to go
There is no pain, you are recading
A distant chip smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves

Your lips move but I can hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a flecting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye

Truths i must be sure
Tossin' turnin', nightmares brunin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the viking spits
The blood of father's land

Only to decieve

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja v?or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Lordy, lordy, they died",Rock

Hole In My Soul

With a one track mind

The punishment sometimes
Don't seem to fit the crime

But one thing i've learned
For every love letter written
There's another one burned
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time

Is it over?
Is it over?
'cause i'm blowin' out the flame

Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns
The knife inside of me

Take a look and you will find
There's nothing there, girl

Yeah, yeah

I got dust for tears
Yeah i'm all tapped out
Sometimes i feel broken and can't get fixed

I know there's been all kinds of shoes
Underneath your bed
Now i sleep with my boots on
But you're still in my head
And something tells me this time
I'm down to my last licks

Then it's over
And it's driving me insane

but you always lookin' like you're mad at the devil

it's just you're much too rude, your fruits are rotten *

She was a wet net winner
And rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night
And wrong all the right out of me
Pass me the vile and cross your fingers

Nowhere to draw the line

Hi we were singin' on your cowboy song
You told carrie
And promised her you wouldn't be long

Standing in a line

Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love

And wouldn't you love to love her

Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win...

And then she is the darkness

Our eyes are closed.
We're lost in one sweet embrace.

Since those days the world has changed.
But our love remains the same.
God knows we've had our share of saving grace.

And I'm proud of all the blessings you have given me.
The mountains we have climbed to get this far.
We've learned to take the laughter with the tears.
After all these years.

You make it feel brand new.
After the fires that we walked through.
Against the odds we never lost our faith.

In a house we made our home.
Where our children all have grown
Precious moments time cannot erase.

Make a living up and down the gypsy highways.
The seasons that we had to share apart.
Somehow in my heart I always keep you near.
After all these years.

After all these years.
You stood by me the days and nights that I was gone.
After all these years.
You sacrificed, believed in me, and you stood strong.

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration

Daddy only stares into the distance

He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts on a red light street

And every single meeting with his so called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish Loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush-hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlight
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache

Yet I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be no optical illusion

And we're dancing in the rain
I join my friends there when I see them
Outside my window pane

First you make a stone of your heart
And if you find that your hands are still willing
Then you can turn a murder into art

There really isn't any need for bloodshed
You just do it with a little more finesse
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C
It's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C

Now if you have a taste for this experience
And you're flushed with your very first success
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less

Because murder is like anything you take to
It's a habit forming need for more and more
You can bump off every member of your family
And anybody else you find a bore

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C
It's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C

You can join the ranks of the illustrious
In history's great dark hall of fame
All our greatest killers were industrious
At least the ones that we all know by name

But you can reach the top of your profession
If you become the leader of the land
For murder is the sport of the elected
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C
Murder by numbers, one, two, three
It's as easy to learn as your A B C D E

Turn on the radio, the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go, I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo, it's played for years and years
An Otis Redding song, it's all I own

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

Plug in my M.C.I. to exercise my brain
Make records on my own, can't go out in the rain
Pick up the telephone, I've listened here for years
No one to talk to me, I've listened here for years

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

When I feel lonely here, don't waste my time with tears
I run 'Deep Throat' again, it ran for years and years
Don't like the food I eat, the cans are running out
Same food for years and years, I hate the food I eat

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

Born In the '50s
We were born
Born in the fifties

My mother cried
When President Kennedy died
She said it was the Communists
But I knew better

Would they drop the bomb on us
While we made love on the beach
We were the class they couldn't teach
'Cos we knew better

We were born
Born in the fifties

They screamed
When The Beatles sang
And they laughed when the king fell down the stars
O they should've known better

O we hated our aunt
Then we messed in our pants
Then we lost our faith and prayed to the TV
O we should've known better

We were born
Born in the fifties

We freeze like statues on the pages of history
Living was never like this when we took all those GCE's
O you opened the door for us
And then you turned to dust
You don't understand us
So don't reprimand us
We're taking the future
We don't need no teacher

Maybe too good to be true

Was as if we floated downstream

In a world made for two

And on the rainy nights we'd hide in our room

And shut out the lights

And when the weather was clear

We knew of a place that no-one came near

If The Stars Come Out Tonight

I'll meet you at our secret place, baby

We can watch the world go by

If The Stars Come Out Tonight

Summertime was the best

Those sun and thunder days

We found us, forgot about the rest

Found new ways to amaze

And we discovered what we meant to each other

Didn't have a dime but we had plenty of time

Did I ever tell you

When I needed a friend,

You were there till the end

Was I there for you

You're getting further away

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a flashing
Plays by sense of smell

Always gets a replay
Never see him fall

Sure plays a mean pinball

But I just handed my pinball crown to him

In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I'll get along

She's just a girl, she's a bomb

Athena, all I ever wanna do is please her
My life has been so settled and she's the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll get along

She's just a girl, she's a bomb
She's a bomb

Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
Felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I'd of topped myself to give her time she didn't need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath

She's just a girl, she's a bomb
She's just a girl, she's a bomb

Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You were requisitioned Blondie

She's just a girl, she's a bomb
I'm happy, she's a bomb, I'm ecstatic

Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Look into the face of a child, measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain

Athena, if you picked me up by my lapels and screamed, ""Leave her""
It felt like waking up in Heaven on an empty meter
And now you're stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that

She's a bomb
I just said it
She's a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb

Athena, I had no idea how much I need her

I call you on the telephone my
Voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes feel I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets

I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex
To the sound of old T-Rex and Who's Next

I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture, I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs

I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh, a little is alright, when you say
""Come over and spend the night, tonight, tonight""

When I say, ""I love you"" you say,""You better""

When I say, ""I need you you"" say,""You better""

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters saying,""You better""
You better bet your life

You better love me all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I'm so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier

I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometimes
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time

And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee and it's free

He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams ain't quite so bad

Ten years old, with thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise, in simplicity

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey and learn all you should know

A vague haze of delirium creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver sparked, glittering gown
And his golden beard flows, nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, nothing to hear and nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

And preachin' from my chair

Back to the rollin' pin

And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the tin pan

When you really want it

Getting burned by the sun

You can always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowing
Don't push the hands
Just hang on to the band
And you can dance while
Your knowledge is growing

(It could happen anytime)
You can't expect to never cry
(Patience is priceless)
Not when you try to fly so high

(Just stay on that line)
Rock and roll will never die
(This is no social crisis)
This is you having fun

(No crisis)
Getting burned by the sun

This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you

Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire y'all
It's all here on the vinyl

Just you having fun

Getting burned by the sun

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, ""Beware doll you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school, all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise with the mystery tramp
But now you realize, he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that he really wasn't where it's at?
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used, go to him now he calls you
You can't refuse, when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel?

In the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly

Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of 'em wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life

Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me

Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove

Well, I can't escape from the memory
Of the one I'll always adore
All those nights when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River shore

Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I've tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of the life of crime

And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song

Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about

Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I've had to pull back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River shore

Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life

Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody ever saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River shore",Rock

Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

379,Bob Dylan,http://www.songlyrics.com/bob-dylan/hurricane-lyrics/,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man, the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he'd never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he coulda been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand""

""I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""

Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he'd never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he coulda been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure""
The cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow""

""You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It's my work"", he'd say, ""And I do it for pay
And when it's over, just as soon go on my way""

Over to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along the trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he'd never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched, he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks, he was just that crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he coulda been
The champion of the world",Rock

I was layin' in bed
Wonderin' if she changed at all
If her hair was still red

Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough

And I was standin' on the side of the road, rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force

We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best

Then she turned around to look at me as I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell

So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix

But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear

And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""

I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type""

Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century

And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air

Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside

And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now

Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives

But me, I'm still on the road headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant

I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go astray?

I passed the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide

I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside

Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away

I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories

My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
Without you near me",Rock

No one in front of me, no one behind
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne

Got white skin, got assassins eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standin' on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose

People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range
I used to care, but things have changed

This place ain't doing me any good
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move

Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through

People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

I've been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can

Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losin' hand

Feel like fallin' in love with the first woman I meet
Puttin' her in a wheel barrow and wheelin' her down the street

People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

I hurt easy, I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity

Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I'm not that eager, not that eager to make a mistake

People are crazy, times are strange

It could sink me then and there

I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed

Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come down off of your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind

Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share

You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now

I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gate

Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
Stars are cold, the night is young

The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky

The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town isn't new
They''ll drag you down, they'll run the show

Tell ol' Bill when he comes home

Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where its always safe and warm
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount
Nothing really matters much, doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now theres a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
""Come in"", She said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razors edge, someday I'll make it mine
I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born

She makes love just like a woman

They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town

Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants

And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As lady and I look out tonight
From desolation row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
It takes one to know one, she smiles
And puts her hands into her back pockets
Bette Davis style

And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
""You belong to me I believe""
And someone turns and says to him
""My friend you'd better leave""

And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On desolation row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars they're just pretending to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside

All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everyone is makin' love
Or else expecting rain

And the good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On desolation row

Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid

Now to her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession is her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness

And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into desolation row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, some jealous monk

Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed his cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet

You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On desolation row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Locked inside of his leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up

Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
She also keeps the cards that read
""Have mercy on his soul""

They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From desolation row

Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The phantom of the opera
In a perfect image of a priest

They're spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the phantom shouts to skinny girls
""Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova he's just being punished for going
To desolation row""

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do

Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene

Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that no one is escaping
To desolation row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which side are you on?""

And Ezra Pound and T.S. Elliott
Fighting in the captain's tower
While Calypso's singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers

Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About desolation row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the door knob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?

All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name

Right now I cannot read too well
Don't send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them

Miscellaneous
In My Life (Lennon/McCartney)



There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watch the time go right out the window

I remembered each flash as time began to blur
Like a startling sign that fate had finally found me

So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide

There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve

So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new divide

In every loss, in every lie, in every truth that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision

And the violet rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there

'Cause we're living at the mercy
Of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it
Let it all disappear, yeah

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade
This life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie

Holding on to what I haven't got

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So picking up the pieces, now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my ******* mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Run myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun, I pull, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama help me I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new Hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works

**** this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

You just turn around and start askin' me about

Used to be generous, you should have known

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hanging out
They said somebody went and burned it down

And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how if feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

'Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long
Time to put the brakes on, doesn't matter when you gotta

Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon

Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox cranking out the CCR
Had a few to Suzie Q this afternoon, oh

Better hang on if you're tagging along
'Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long
Time to put the brakes on, doesn't matter when you gotta

Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again
Get up, go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again, yeah
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

Wear a wristwatch and alarm clock to see what time it ends
From the moment I wake up, I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times and hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down, so we can do it all again

It's not a human walk, it's the human race
If we were living on the edge, taking too much space
So I'll doubt I'll figure out just what to do
But to kicking around, hanging out this afternoon, oh

Better hang on if you're tagging along
'Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning
Nothing wrong with going all night long

Like wounded soldiers in need of healing.
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it, cause I didn't mean it

I cant believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter cause I've made it up forgive me now
Everyday I spend away my souls inside out
Gotta be someway that I can make it up to you now, somehow.

By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if your ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now this I vow

By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you

Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you

Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to

And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

With scars on both his lips, his fingertips
Were melted to the bone

When I found him in an alley
In the middle of the night

He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing
And pretended not to know

He started stealing to supply the feeling
Found out he pulled a knife on someone's wife
And held it to her throat

It's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him

Clenching his hands
She's just a woman
Never again

I hear her scream from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me
Go back to bed
I'm terrified that she'll wind up

Dead in his hands
She's just a woman
But never again
Been there before
But not like this
Seen it before
But not like this
Never before
Have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again

Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you
She wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room

With those hands
Lookin' just as sweet as he can
Never again
Seen it before
But not like this
Been there before

You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard, don't hit a lady
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure

Oh
Ohh
He's drunk again it's time to fight
Same old shit just on a different night
She grabs the gun
She's had enough
Tonight she'll find out
How fucking tough

Is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can

Seen it before
But not like this
Been there before

I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty
I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake

She just gets bored sitting by the lake

Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
And I boast that it is meant to be, but in all honesty
I don't have a hope in hell

You said and all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me since I was
Always caged and now I'm free

To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself
And you bleed and breathe the air

You just kinda stared at me
We will always have the chance
We can do this one more time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora

Take me now, we can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down

One that made you have to say goodbye

Touch your lips and hold you near
When you say your prayers understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I wish I was him with these words of mine
To say to you till the end of time

That I will love you baby

And I'll be there forever and a day

If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face

To say these words to you

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps it's own beat

About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth and what you mean to me

Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, ""Baby, blind love is true""

Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is

The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
I might have said, ""Yeah""

Oo yeah

Now as you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress, she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone but you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

Trying to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man

Every time he had to leave
I was much too young to understand
When he would say to me

When you're young, you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day you'll have to say
Hello to goodbye

Sit down son, come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You live before you die

I was barely seventeen
Summer of seventy nine
Already I was feeling like
I was running out of time

I had this girl, we fell in love
Should I say that she had me?
That fateful night we'd change our lives
And made a memory

When you're young, you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day you'll have to say
Hello to goodbye

She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me she said
You gotta live before we die
Live before you die

You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
Live before you die

I made mistakes, I've caught some breaks
But I've got no regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

The sun is gonna shine
One day you're gonna have to say
Hello to goodbye

Shout it out, let someone somewhere
Know you're alive

'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares, I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head
While we're talking about all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby, you're all that I need

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well, I'm so far away that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night
Just to see through this pay phone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, baby, blind love is true

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
I might have said, yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

When you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress, she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone but you know
That don't mean I'm not lonely, I've got nothing to prove

When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said, ""All the men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""

But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers

There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever while Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Rock

Into the masterpiece

And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive
A thousand kisses deep

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me

I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked
A thousand kisses deep

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
I'm back on Boogie Street
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep

And quiet is the thought of you
The file on you complete
Except what we forgot to do
A thousand kisses deep

The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

I'd like to try to read your palm

Before I let you take me home

Now so long Marianne
It's time we began to laugh and cry
And cry and laugh about it all again

Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the Angel
And then the Angels forget to pray for us

To laugh and cry and cry
And laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Ah so long Marianne
It's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry
And laugh about it all again

Your letters they all say that you are beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long Marianne
It's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry
And laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razor blade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Oh so long Marianne
It's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry
And laugh about it all again

Ohh you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I can climb this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much""

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

As for me and all, all I ever learnt from love
Is how to shoot at someone who outgrew you

No, it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah

Love is not some kind of victory march
No, it's a cold and it's a very lonely Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
Ah, but now you never show it to me, do you?

I remember when I moved you
And the Holy Dove, she was moving too
Every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah

I couldn't feel so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I did not come here to Coachella to fool you

She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker, every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
And the fiddler fiddles something so sublime

The men they dance on the polka-dots

And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, 'where's the beef?

And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime

A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch

And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime

And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth

And it's once for the Devil and it's once for Christ

Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter

I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter

That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter

And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came, I was a stranger""

To ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other

His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Oh, you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker

And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter

You try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
And it is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another

Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
Well he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river

Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising, ""One more shelter""
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, ""Okay the bridge or someplace later""

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much

I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, my little darling, I don't even think of you that often",Rock
567,Leonard Cohen,http://www.songlyrics.com/leonard-cohen/sisters-of-mercy-lyrics/,"Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been traveling so long

Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right",Rock

a thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, see I’m just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love and his second hand physique, with he is and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat, to pose all hot and high behind the veils of shear deceit, a perfect born aristocrat so elegant and cheap, I’m old but I’m still into that,
A thousand kisses deep

I’m good at love, I’m good at hate, its in between I freeze. Been working out, but its too late, it’s been to late for years. But you look good, you really do, they love you on the street. If I could move I’d kneel for you,
a thousand kisses deep.

The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye, a light that doesn’t need to live, and doesn’t need to die. A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete, to witness tear and time and blood,
A thousand kisses deep.

I’m still working with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek, the band is playing Auld Laing Sine, but the heart will not retreat. I ran with Dez and I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep, but once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to heat, just another snowman standing in the sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep

But you don’t need to hear me now, and every word I speak, it counts against me anyhow,
A thousand kisses deep.",Rock

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Oh, like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Our kisses deep and warm
Your head upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us
I know that we are not new
In city and in forest
They smiled like me and you
But now it's come to distances
And both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
  (Hey)
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another
As I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner
Our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you
As your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes
Like the shoreline and the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow

Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

Who in the sunshine, who in the night time?
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial?
Who in your merry, merry month of May?
Who by very slow decay?
And who, who shall I say is calling?

And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate?
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt?
And who by avalanche, who by powder?
Who for his greed, who for his hunger?
And who, who shall I say is calling?

And who by brave assent, who by accident?
Who in solitude, who in this mirror?
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand?
Who in mortal chains, who in power?

As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her Armour bright
Then no man to get her through this darkest very smoky night

She said, ""I'm tired of the war
I want the kind of work I had before
With a wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite""

Well, I'm glad to to hear you talk this way
You see I've watched you riding all most every single day
And theres something in me yearns to win
Such a very cold and such a very lonesome heroine

â€½Well then, who are you?"" she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke
""Why, I'm, I'm fire,"" he replied
""And I love your solitude, how I love your sense of pride""

""Well then fire, make your body cold
I'm gonna give you mine to hold""
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of a Joan of Arc
And high above all these assembled wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her very lovely wedding dress

It was deep deep into his fiery heart
That he took the dust of all precious Joan of Arc
Then she clearly clearly understood
If if he was fire, oh she must be wood

I saw her wince, I saw her cry
I saw the glory in her eye
Myself I long, I long for love and light

I lived my life in Babylon

And I did forget my holy song
And I had no strength in Babylon

By the river's dark, where I could not see
Who was waiting there, who was hunting me?

And he cut my lip and he cut my heart
So I could not drink from the river dark

And he covered me and I saw within
My lawless heart and my wedding ring

I did not know and I could not see
Who was waiting there, who was hunting me?

By the river's dark, I panicked on
I belonged at last to Babylon

Then he struck my heart with a deadly force
And he said, ""This heart, it is not yours""

And he gave the wind, my wedding ring
And he circled us with everything

By the river's dark in a wounded dawn
I live my life in Babylon

Though I take my song from a withered limb
Both song and tree they sing for him

Be the truth unsaid and the blessing gone
If I forget my Babylon

I did not know and I could not see
Who was waiting there, who was hunting me?

By the river's dark where it all goes on
By the river's dark in Babylon",Rock

Straight from the sun above
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of love

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see
Out of which the nameless makes
A name for one like me

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love Itself, love itself was gone

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself, love itself was gone

Then I came back from where I'd been
My room, it looked the same
But there was nothing left between
The nameless and the name

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door

Love itself, love itself was gone",Rock

There's a shoulder where death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in theGallery of Frost

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea

There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
But who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years

There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow

Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its, I'll never forget you, you know
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss

And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is

Aey, aey, aey, aey",Rock
