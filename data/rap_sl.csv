I hit her with a one-two like Mike
Cause your nigga ain't doing it right
You know my jewelry shine bright
My phone ring and I'm coming right now
Beat it up then I lay that ass down

Run up on him, then we kick his door

And if I call the crib he'll bring the pole
And if I say the word, let it go
Spending all my time counting Benjamin Franklins
Interrupt the count, what the fuck is you thinkin'
Hit the bank teller, bring a hunnid in Franklin's
Right before I leave, I salute him and thank him
(Thank you buddy) Thank you buddy
Yeah baby, riding through the city, yeah
Gotta get it, yeah, yeah baby

A couple bandz on my left and my right

I just wanna say what's on my mind man

We designed down rocking Fendi
Big chargers with the hemi
We pull up on ya'll, nigga gimme
I make them honchos hit a semi
I'm talking mula, we got plenty
I fuck her best friend if she pretty
You know it's ZooGang niggas with me
I let off two bangs to his kidney (bang bang)
Then take his baby momma out to Pheonix
Sent the kids on trip to Walt Disney
I've yet to see a nigga ball with me
Monty and Dice standing tall with me
I collect them bands then hit the mall with em
One act up, then we all get em (all get em)
One shoot one sound we all hit em (all hit em)
Two doors no top its all missing (all missing)
Niggas know how I rock I'm all in
23 on my J I'm Jordan (my jump shots like that man)
Niggas know how I rock I'm all in 23 on my J I'm jordan
Heard these niggas hatin me because that ima specialist
Diamonds know they on freeze thats how you know I'm flexing man
Remixin the whole thing thats how you get ya paper up
First she wasn't on me but she wanna hang wit us
Rollin off the molly Now she wanna skate wit us
Before you try the ZooGanck suggest you try some angel dust
Monty shoot from long range that's how he let the hammer bust
AR15 my chopper tote an extendo
Shooting big guns it can not fit out the window
How the fuck you judge a nigga don't know what he been thru
Niggas don't know me might've seen me when I bent thru 22 forgiato sittin on a fen coup
Zoovier you won't catch me without monty
Last year I told em this year was our time and I did what I said now we all shinin
Jump mans for the kicks blue in our diamonds
Robins gold wings trues are now lying 2 Bandz one outfit come on try me
I ain't even touch the advance I been
band up jugin and finnessin and niggas ain't gettin jammed up
Robin wings on my robin jeans hold my bands 22nd ima hooligan I need a phantom bitches love me cause I'm getting rich I ain't handsome

Please miss me with that gun shit if you do not let them go
Cause big ZooWap with crip and he ain't scared to let you know
If you disrespect ZooWap, only one place you gon' go
I ain't making no threats man, I just thought that you should know
I got way more money than ya, I throw money you can't throw
I know bigger homies nigga, I know homies you should know
I done been to Cali nigga, I done smoked the finest dope
I done smoked about ten pounds and sold a million pills
Remember days on the back block, we stashed the bricks in [?]
Beans was pulling them cars out, we thought it never end
We was living like stars now, [?] we was kids
Put the pill in the Remy man, bitches do as you please
You ain't sucking no dick ho then, pack your shit and leave

I'ma snatch a couple beamers ‘cause I like how they be skurt
My favorite rapper Gucci Guwop a.k.a. that's mister perfect
Bitch, they call me Fetty ZooWap a.k.a. I'm mister swerving
Hundred grams, I hit a doowop off the block ‘cause I was serving
And I build it Dennis Rodman minus one where I was working
And your bitch, she want the dick and I can tell ‘cause she be flirting
All I know is get it in, I sold them skinnies for a thirty
And don't talk about them pistols ‘cause Fetty Cash come out and hurt ya
What you know ‘bout party packs, five dollars pills start on a Thursday
We was flipping ‘bout two thousand right before we entered Friday
Had the '38 stashed in the Honda on a highway
Bitch, I'm Fetty Gucci ZooWap and I say that very proudly

If you trynna match it
Grit and dice on twenty eight
Trappin' out the mansion

Old school days 
Box chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip 
And put ZooWap on the landmark
Through these streets I'm movin quick
Like Big ZooWap a land shark

Talkin shit can't leave yo block
That's how you get yo landmark
Heavy cheese, my neck on freeze
And Gucci Mane my role model

Everytime I hit the club
We pop atleast bout' four bottles
Everytime we leave the club
You see all the hoes follow

If that nigga actin crazy
He gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap I don't give a fuck
Got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check
I go get bout' four raris'

ZooWap I'm the motherfuckin' best compared to nobody
Laser tips will beam you up
But baby weon' know scotty
ZooWap I'm the motherfuckin' best compared to nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check 
I go get four raris'
Laser tips will beam me up
But baby weon' know scotty

They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy

'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me

Kick her out the house politely

Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom

Cut these bitches off like hibachi

If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing
Up to par, my swag from London
These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'

You wanna get married to a rich man

But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand

Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch he's leaking
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget
Nah for real
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about?
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that magic up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up, and bust it down
Migo (?), whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
J-1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a (Hot) Boy, so you know I gotta stay low
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet
Set! Told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check
I'm a young nigga, with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it
I don't want to kick it
After my show
The gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke swishers, like a regular nigga
Now I'm a backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he run up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a Bieber
Now people they screaming out ""Free Activis""
They talking bout that Activis be discontinued
Kept my cup of muddy trouble, trapper, got packs in the attic
Kept me 'round, with pricing my rental
Trap, trap down when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick, and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my time, must've (?)

He had some jewelry on him, worth $100, so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own him
Now my squad, they going nuts, no Makonnen
In the players pad, at the Caesar's Palace

We don’t even kick it like that dog
Quick to spray a nigga like Lysol

Quavo wanna see you pop it nasty
Lil mama so thick, look like Kim Kardashian
But no I'm not wifing, young nigga passin'
She making Impala at the 4th of July
She know I got millions, no need to lie
Tattoo on her booty is a butterfly
I bet when she make it pop, it's gonna fly
Soda pop booty, she poppin' her booty like popcorn, and it's wobblin'
Wanna take her home, when I get in the room, when I get the pussy, I'mma dive in it
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it
I reach in my pocket, I slap her on the ass, told her she better not stop poppin' it
Everybody know that she a cutie
You keep spendin' money, she make you foolish
But look at me, Young Quavo, I'mma do it
She poppin' it on me, she make me lose it
I run out of cash, hit the ATM
I'm livin' my life like the game of Sims
She stump the booty on me like a pair of Timbs

White girls, I got jungle fever
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker
Hit her one time, then I leave with the leader
Run around, jump up and down like a pogo
I brought the camera, we might make a porno
I had to pop her up, my game for a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
(?)
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter
She in my trap while she poppin' the castle
Speed it up, then she go slow
Grippin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll
She go harder than the concrete
Italian tailor, Givenchey
Money longer than a bungy
All this damn gold like a treasury
Lick on me like I am licorice
Burkin bag, she an expensive bitch
She ratchet, she still got the kinky twist
Pop it, pop it, in my Bentley bitch

The way that she suckin it, I might be taking it
Breaking it but no relationship
Bigger booty, no big booty Judy
Her pussy wet when she get on that percocet
She looked at my hand, saw it full of bands
Put a little bit, bitch pop that
I'm throwin' cash, cash, all niggas see is ass
It must be an ass attack
Do you want some of these old hundreds baby?
I'm talkin' older than Thundercats
She shakin', she know her ass fat
Got me thinkin' where is her momma at
All the bitches starin' at you in the club
Cause they know that you be poppin' that
She breakin' it, makin' the club shake
She done gave her old man a heart attack

[Verse 4:]
She shakin' like she care, look in the mirror
No ass shots, her booty real
She poppin' her nigga no Activis here
Bad bitches tell me how you feel

But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, suprise on your birthday

Baby girl, what you gon' do?

Pull up Audi like the raider

Cause I be drippin', dabbin' all on your bitches
My pockets is fat, but my pants leg is skinny
Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I dreamed a genie
Phantom pull up after the Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas Bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor
I do not trust her, she suckin' the plastic
I beat it, I killed it, put it in a casket

Know that she ratchet and she is not classy

Nigga can you flip it all, can you make a fifty ball
In the streets I’m a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Selling rolls, no Quan, Roll Latifah said it all
Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Move the work out to Memphis so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know that you false
Rick Ross ain’t the only nigga in the world boss
Put the Forgi’s on the old school, riding Chevy T-top
When a nigga walk up on me, freeze him like a freeze pop
Feeling like a DJ, hit em with the rerock
Feeling like I’m lost nigga rerock on the D-block

I can make 100 thousand dollars with no effort
Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
Imma put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping active, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don’t need to count it
You a cannibal, run off with the pack, eat em like animals
Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole

Told mama, ""sorry, pockets on infinity""

Band jump like trampoline in my Billy Jeans
Ride around smoking on stank
Switch your hair around like you’re Rodman
Your hair matching my drink, I’mma need you on the whole paint
It’s like going on a date with a different woman every time I step out
Your hair stand out, my money

Go up
She change her hair so many colors, it’s like I'm living living color
Her pussy wet just like the water

She wanna marry me, I told her maybe one day
She paint it blue so I turn her on her pee way
Double G is her wing, man,so we call her lil Gucci
No ring on her finger, the only thing I look for
They follow my wheels, around my fortune like they figure this
Pull up to the light, jump out, I tie my shoe

Half a nation my pit stop but it do not stand for friendly
Got a nigga going like look, cameras, you ready to die like Big, yeah?

Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit em with the tackle, pull out the chopper, not fronting I’ll rush em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel

Walk up in the trap house, got me sneezin' like they pollen

Poppin' (?), no Mike Will we made it

Have a party at the mansion with 20 acres
You got foes at the gate like you got hit with (?)
Fuck your bitch, I don't save her
She poppin' the molly right down like a gator
Wanna have a party?

I'll rather be rich, I flex with your bitch
You can have the fame, you can have the gold chain
M's nigga, 100 M's nigga
Got some niggas in the hood, they got M's nigga
Ask P, ask me
Northside Migo gang OG
Ridin' round, deuces on a damn Audi
Before I had a deal, young nigga copped it
Them dubs, them fifties, them hundreds, my trap always bunkin' you niggas is funny
I'm laughin with money, beatin the pot like I'm Sonny
Taking them trips making them flip
12 hit the block then I dip
Callin' up P, for the whips
Get in the pot then I WHIP!

I don't know why the lord save me
I had to get rid of them babies
I'm at the top, Ima Uranus, Versace my neck and my panky
My momma she told me I made it, Im tired of my family slavin
Daddy was a hospital patient, next thing you know he couldn't make it
I put my head down I ain't cry, cuz then I ain't know what death mean
Then a when a nigga growed up I ain't have my daddy on the scene
So a nigga had to lend to his momma, So a nigga had to go chase commas
Use to eat dollar menu at mcdonalds, now I'm eating big plates at
Benihanas, gone

But its hard as hell, the man above for showing me love
Im taking them trips to Beverly Hills, runnin through hoes
And counting them M's, living life high like [?]
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money

You would think I would be in dem cages
So every day I wake and thank him
From kickin dem doors sellin them babies
To walkin through Jeff for a price of a baby
I swear its a blessing I never regret it
This shit gets so hetic a nigga start stressing
The clips ain't helping looking at my smith & wesson
Looking for them vegetarians I'm taking yo lettuce and celery

Broke up with the old me
Yeah I had to glow up


Use to take da bus to get to high school
Now I'm pulling up
Phantom drop down in the drive-thru
Use to wake up starving, had no cash too
Now I'm at the jeweler adding fruity stones
What the bands do
Cycling the hoes that I ran thru
Now I hit it once I don't want it 'less the pussy brand new
Started with a 8 ball, where that land you?
Lookin' like a lick, flip a brick, they can't stand you
I just re'd up from my jeweler
Glam Boy don't buss down the mueller
Remind me of cookouts
Back when, way back
Dippin' my hands in the cooler
Remember amount on zero
Banking account on zero
Now my wrist sub-zero



Diamonds they spin like Serato
Can't go back to broke
'Cause my heart is hollow
Unfollowed all my friends
Who the hell do I know
Can't go back to broke
'Cause my heart is hollow
'Cause my heart is hollow
Broke up with the old me
Yeah I had to glow up
Broke up with the old me
Yeah I had to glow
Broke up with the old me
Yeah I had to glow up
Broke up with the old me
Yeah I had to glow up",Rap

Feelings gone
Did a nigga wrong
You a fed to me
G wagon
Skating off like what these Jewish telling me
Selling me
Save my money
Unless that shit is luxury

Heavy In The Game
*1 [Eboni Foster] Game's been good to me
	*2 [Eboni Foster] I don't care what it did to them
			  The game's been good to me

[Lady Levi]
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, everytime seen?

Verse One: 2Pac

Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bitches
who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, niggaz know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin poppin 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game *1

[Lady Levi]
Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Oooh, me see you rushin up *1
I throw 'im blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting 
for ya take dis ting for joke? *2
Oh!  Dat's right

Verse Two: Richie Rich

Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of shit..
Certain niggaz wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggaz be twistin and takin shit
Puttin they sack down, then puttin they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meanin buy yo' own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, somethin I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
ain't healthy, niggaz be endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin major
so what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin residential
to a, young nigga workin presidential *1

[Lady Levi]
Me nigga Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'im look good every time
Ooh, pussy war?  Step up *1
Can yi know I'm servin up blood claat
playin yi fuckin games
Ooh, we take game, we WON *2
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime

Verse Three: 2Pac

I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin high, gettin mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggaz I despise -- them loud talkin cowards 
shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin to make the news, niggaz confused
Quit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
and come the riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game *1

[Lady Levi]
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good everytime
when we at Beers Diamond
and Tupac drives vintage car *1
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?

For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!

Quarter million, put it in the air
Grover called me, told me that it's there
Rich nigga rockin' Montclair
Change of plans, I ain't playin' fair

Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches

I fuck the baddest bitches
I came from rags to riches
I fuck the baddest bitches

Givenchy, givenchy, givenchy
I rock givenchy, I do this shit for a living
The narcs in the hood, they been trippin'
All in my business, so all my rental cars tinted
Boy I ain't been broke in a minute, I swear I been gettin' it
Still sendin' packs to the prison
Run the money all the way up, wonderful feeling
Bust down Rollies came from scratch
Catch a nigga slipping, do him bad
Take a nigga's shit, won't give it back
Half a bag, get a nigga whacked
Wreck the Masi, go and get a Jag
Hellcat goin' real fast
Fuck 12, I ain't goin' back
Do it for the shit I never had
Niggas droppin' songs 'cause they mad
They don't wanna see me with a bag
A lot of times I just wanna spazz
But I fall back and just laugh
I won't let you trick me out my spot
Niggas having pressure 'bout a thot
These bitches lovin' the crew
We take 'em down by the two

Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag

I'm in this bitch with TP
I'm in this bitch with 4trey
I just poured up me a 8
Real nigga all in my face
500 racks in my safe
500 racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love
What you know 'bout pullin' up, in Bentley trucks
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoe
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together we came from
the bottom we used to wear each other clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no mo'
Hold it down for the 4
In the 9 with the woah's
Marlo my dawg that's for sho'
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gone fallout bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both my ears on froze
I been gettin faded I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball I don't layup
I'm a big boss I got say so
They'll wipe you down If I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
40's, on 40's, on 40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina shout out New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck
Hop out fresher than a mento
Lil nigga but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, two calls
Cross a nigga up, hot sauce
Ooh I got 'em mad, my fault
Talking bout the shit that I bought
Poppi'n these perks I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangsta but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the game to the fullest
I run with some real ones I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a vert with a uzi
Twelve get behind me I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy

Mama sent a text that she proud of me
Youngins in the hood watchin' out for me
Money all colors like monopoly
Park the Jeep, hop in the VIP
Stay on they ass, stay on they neck
Keep me a check
Viper came yellow, I painted it red
And I paid cash, you heard what I said
Goin' crazy, I been feelin' the rage
Last year I was sittin' in the cage
This year I'm goin' all the way
Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain

They on my pave
They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through

Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from
Young niggas goin' straight dumb
Fifty hollow tips in each drum
Throwing fours up with lil one
Hoppin' out trucks, we suited up, we ready for war, yeah

Cartier on my face with the wood tear

Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great

I stole them, ran them bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin'
like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Sames one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing subs at the clique

I asked you about it, did you lie?
You asked me about it,
I kept it 100, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent 2, 000 on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
200 hoes in my call log and they ain't got not a namesake
Took her out the hood,
put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and [?] had two different spots,
we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free my bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get
tired, you can see the adderall in my eyes
Tyga said he got the drop on the album
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block

We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no funny, no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
When the wifey, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything they say fake news
Can't take that, new Lamborghini 18
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep buying all these phantoms
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

Whenever I ain't rappin' I'm sellin' this bail
My nigga got caught, I just hope he don't tell
If you can sit quiet then I'll pay your bail
They not gon' snitch if they send me to hell

Then I start rappin' and got me a deal
I took off fast, this shit get for real
She want to talk but she don't want to hear
All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is
I'm on my grind, so fuck how you feel
I got some homies who sittin' in the pen
Yeah, yeah
They gon' be sittin' in that bitch for some years
We were some teens, they labeled us grown
Had some judges who doin' us wrong
I know your pain just hold on
Just sing this song

Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him

123,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/survival-lyrics/,"feat.  Liz Rodrigues (The New Royales)


[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

[Verse 1]
Wasn't ready to being a millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straight up, up wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
Cause I just shitted on the mic, and like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdri-vers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, I just go atchoo then achieve!

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside

Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me

To take a stand, to take a stand
  (Yeah, it's been a ride)
Everybody, everybody
  (I guess I had to)
Come take my hand, come take my hand
  (Go to that place to get to this one)

We'll walk this world together through the storm
  (Now some of you)
Whatever weather, cold or warm
  (Might still be in that place)
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
  (If you're tryin' to get out)
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
  (Just follow me, I'll get you there)

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think

I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony

No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to that last ""Relapse"" album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got
The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shoudldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD, was ""eh""
Perhaps I ran the max and since hit the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow
'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'
I don't know how, I'm way too rough to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage

I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Tryin' to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama, from now on I promise to only focus
On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughter
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquour counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'

And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this route together through the storm

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going? I'm leaving you, no, you ain't
Come back, we're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back

She's Lois Lane but when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name

You meet, and neither one of you even know it hit 'em

Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each others hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the race that took over, it controls you both
So they say you'd best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it ""window pane""

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire

Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it?

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clock's run out, times up, over, blaw!

Oh, there goes Rabbit he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows

He knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows

And hope it don't pass him

But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows it's all over, these h**s is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads

God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These h**s don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on

Tear this mothaf****n' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped, writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these *** damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail

Success is my only mothaf****n' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot
Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?

I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen

Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room

Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like

Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help

Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that

'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different

I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon

And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful",Rap
129,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/space-bound-lyrics/,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cuz you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cuz if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cuz I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya

Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes

Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm witchu I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, witchu I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelin's change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you musta been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake
'Cuz I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and 6 months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much, it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Til' I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't a possible reason

I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I woulda did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cuz I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you",Rap
130,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/cleanin-out-my-closet-lyrics/,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha""

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha""

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

And I'm just happy to not be that person anymore, and so is my wife
Thank you for letting me do this
That's all I have to share right now

Is there anyone else who would like to share with us tonight?
Uhh yeah
My name is Marshall
(Hi Marshall)
Yeah, it's my life, in my own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their Armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em

But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane

Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka by baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing she keeps screamin'
She don't want me to sing
â€½You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy crying?â€

Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more
â€½Daddy you're lying
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're mineâ€

She's piling boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
â€½Daddy please daddy, don't leave daddy no, stop itâ€
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got a picture
â€½This'll keep you safe daddy, take it witchaâ€

I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talkin' 'cuz man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show â€~em that you love â€~em for it's too late

And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone
And the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow, â€½And thank you all for comin' outâ€
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
â€½Daddy it's me, help mommy her wrists are bleedin'â€,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin
It says, ""Number 1 dad"", that's all I wanted
I just want to give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'

But baby wait
It's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show â€~em that you love â€~em more than us
That's what they want, they want you Marshal, they keep
screamin your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep

Just take another, pill, yeah I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah word, keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me

I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream â€~Gosh Shady' and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes

That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin'
There's birds singin', it's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on

Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

Curtain Call
When I'm Gone
[Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice

And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain

And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain

They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling

Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
   (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?

Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive Gluteus Maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact I see a grin
Now come in, girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charley Horse her
Sorry Portia but what's Ellen DeGeneres have that I don't?
Are you telling me tenderness?

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middle man
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

And little bit did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

And that's why my love you'll never live without
I know you want me, girl, 'cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad? You should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth bruh
Wowzers! I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip, Jessica
Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

So baby
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down

Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss""
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals"", well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady

Guess there's a slim shady in all of us

135,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/mockingbird-lyrics/,"Yeah, I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip, what you cryin' about? You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney
Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever
Bein' together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be but it's just somethin'
That we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny, I remember back one year
When daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree

And said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom, was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart

And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' daddy on the TV

And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were too young
To understand that papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry, you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin', lookin'
At your baby pictures, it just trips me out to see how much
You both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird, I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing
And that ring don't shine, I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad, ha ha",Rap
136,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/stan-lyrics/,"My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam

I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man

He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said ""No""
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?

You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the air in the night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him

That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now

I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me

See Slim, ""Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk""
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too

Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin''
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little

I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was you! Damn!",Rap

Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?

Hi kids, do you like violence?

Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a basehead""
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted

Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, ""Let's just be friends""

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Hi, my name is, my name is

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk

I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks

When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits

How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head

I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
And the further I walked, the louder
I paused for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cuz after all this is her place
So I gave her the benefit of the doubt
Think I might be about Busta Busta
The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, there we go, yo
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario, though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for
Anyone, ever, Yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Drake, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin my goddamn Jigga on
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the game of

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
[And I told her go where you want
And go do what you want to do; I don't care]x2

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called you
""Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' ferris wheel
Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day""
Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for yah
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah
This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'

So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatched my housekey off my keychain
She jumped off, Wee-Bey from The Wire, scape
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day, cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes
Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
But them other F-U-C-K's all would've hit the off ramp
So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree
Now here she comes at full speed, she's racin' at me
Okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'
I body slam her onto the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Bury this stink ho in it, then payed to have the street re-paved
Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event
I said ""hit the road"" and after she left
I sent that bitch a text
I said ""be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace
Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling ""rape""
So the vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late
Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of

Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open bibles

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niqqas know I lay 'em down, make you beg

Ok, you want me up in the cage then I'll come out in beast-mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood Gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more

Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Get 'em

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fixin' to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now I stick it in

I ain't never giving in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them, so why the fuck would I join them when I beat them?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'mma let you finish in a minute, yeah, the rap was tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game, I self-started a Roc fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm staying on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more

Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Bitch, you get no love",Rap

Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze? Please I'm a human being
I have needs, I'm not done not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mister officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer
I just like to pee, pee, pee

I sing song that go ringy chong
Ching chong chong chong ching

Now they gettin' older, they startin' to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze? Jeez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look I put it away my zipper zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman
This movie is P.G. mister officer, I demand to see my attorney

I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer is with Michael?
He's too busy, I'm triumph
Britney spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you laugh
'Cos there's a puppet on my hand

Hilary Duff is
Not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass
And she'll make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she dances like a gogo
In that video she sings 'Get out' you bozo
I need a new boyfriend, 'Hi my name is Jojo'
Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just baked cookies
Mister officer, lookie, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me

I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psyche, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee
Quick get to the chopper, everybody get down
I'm not Triumph, I'm Arnold get down

You make my pee pee go

Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you
Okay

How could you? Just leave me and love him out the blue
Oh, what's a matter Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time

At first, I'm like, you wanna throw me out? That's fine
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at Kim, look at your husband now
No
I said look at him! He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk! Why are you doing this?

I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only 18 that was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
I love you
Oh God my brain is racing
I love you
What are you doing?

Change the station I hate this song, is this look like a big joke?

Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me

Fuck you, you did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Oh my God I'm crackin' up, get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?

And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn't it?
Yes
That was funny wasn't it?
Yes!
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
No

And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
Oh my God
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've, hey where you going? Get back here

You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! Ha! Got'cha!
Ahh
Ha! Go ahead yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah somebody help!

Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
(Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
(Speak to me)

I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
(Is on empty)

No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
(Liftin' you 10 feet)
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
(Of all you)
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
(On Marilyn)

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now, it's a tragedy
Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin'
(This happenin')

Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
(Rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is""

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am

Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time

Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys

That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go

Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance

Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind

I'm in jail and I don't know what happened

Down the street screamin' ""Ah ah ah ah""
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said. ""Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body""

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
'Til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
I cannot moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still, man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers, I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you 'oh
Now I'm special, ha, I felt special when I was with you

All I ever felt was this, helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch, chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I can't just walk away
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in, so I guess, I'mma mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I'mma, ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss

You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip hop, I'm leaving you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life",Rap
146,Eminem,http://www.songlyrics.com/eminem/kill-you-lyrics/,"When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again

You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor

From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, ""Shut up"", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead

[Snoop]
Whassup nephew?
Sittin here choppin game, my nigga Bad Azz
Niggaz get the misconception of us
cause we so cold at what we do
But I really wanna let niggaz know what's happenin though
You feel me?

[Chorus: KoKane, Snoop]
[K] Now I don't want anybody
to get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothin to hide
I want the world to see..
[S] I'm a gangsta gangsta
Gangsta niggaz do your dance
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

[Bad Azz]
See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Poppin collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoein cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn
Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C.
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullsheeit

Knockin' out without protection though that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you're gonna listen you can drop it like it's hot

Niggaz got this ass motherfuckin' up
Aiy baby, aiy baby aiy baby get
Some bubblegum in this motherfucker
Steady long, steady long nigga

With so much drama in the L B C
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D O double G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I, kick a little something for the G's
And, make a few ends as I breeze, through
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
'Cause my momma ain't home

I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
And, they ain't leavin' til six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do? Shit I got a pocket
Full of rubbers and my homeboys do too

So turn off the lights and close the doors
But we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D O G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie
She used to be the homeboys lady
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, 'cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Bitch, I'm just

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homey
Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke shit, this ain't no joke

I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do' and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, biatch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, biatch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind",Rap

And right now the way you lookin bitch you fly as fuck
I don't even know if I done had too much
You play too much, I had to fuck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut
.. You can't tell me nuttin
Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your homegirl want some, I just might bank her
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold
Never, ever, overexpose
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes

Bitch stop my dick hurtin, now fuck Daz

Hook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low

Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah
Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
.. Hov ain't into backwards mackin
.. How backwards that is
.. I don't love 'em though
'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast
I'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 hoes
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me
Ma, you can keep your head

155,Snoop Dogg,http://www.songlyrics.com/snoop-dogg/vato-lyrics/,"I was chillin' right around my way
21st Eastside at a beach
This lil' fool ran up on me
Poppin' off wit his homies like he was a straight G

Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Bang my sound, nag one of them
Some things, son, they just don't change
Fools don't respect nothin' but to *** bang

What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you suckers runnin' like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East wit it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain
And they gon' leave with it

But they don't know, once they get close
That's tic tac toe, 3 lil' G's laid on the floor
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West, they spray, I heard an ese say, he said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, â€½You know who we areâ€
He said, â€½I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Doggâ€

They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
And what he get?
He got his *** and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just charged

Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 wannabes dead and I ain't seen s***
And these suckers'll scream for plea
But for like a G like me, it's just a case
Whether you could see

I crack the mac back and pop off rollin'
And snap your neck back, you chop off fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Bump that, I ain't give a f*** about the law
Say they wanna brawl
You would think that they wore bra's
Believe in all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menathol

You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow all my dough?
What the f***? No
See these suckers proceed to speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you hear my enemies goin'

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, â€½You know who we areâ€
He said, â€½I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Doggâ€

They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
And what he get?
He got his *** and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just charged

Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run

I wouldn't be the G that I am
If I didn't pop suckers in their mouth
I'll be damned
If Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave them cover in sheets
Run wit the homies wit the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wantin' peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, you lil' buster

I never hesitate to blaze
Look, I'm really tryna change my ways
I gotta move my team 'cuz my people's are screamin'
That, â€½We need more for fun or is it legal?â€
[Incomprehensible]

On this song, make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A.
All I hear the eses say, they go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, â€½You know who we areâ€
He said, â€½I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Doggâ€

They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car

Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home
With them real big hips, she's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?""
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say ****""

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

Is you alive like a side do
All I wanna do is like be inside you
Ride you, try to find you
Fill you, revive you

Going with your bad self baby 'cause I do adore
And I give you more
Put it on you all the time you know me amore
We got for sure, pure, alivea lore
Don't trip, I ain't leaving you for

Jaze got Beyonce, I got Shante
With no entrÃ©e, that's my baby
You know the thing about when I bring 'em out
Feels so good I had to sing about

Get it, get it now we flying out of town
Checking in the suite, pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Hey yo, Jaz tell 'em how I put it down

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

Is it the way you look?
Is it the way you walk?
Is it the way you cook?
Is it the way you talk?

I think it's all of the above
No play time in the day time, making love
Kids go to school, we can act a fool

Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Hey yo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking

Ladies if your man make you say
He's here to stay, here to stay

Oh, oh yes, I am this my plan
You my girl, I'm your man
Take your pain, take my hand
Take my name, make my kids

Do your thing, ain't no game
Show no shame if I'm the boss
Boss lady must be your name, so I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back brand new tattoo

20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows
Now days I ain't moving that wow, I changed my style

It might happen to you what gotten to me
Shit, I gotten to you and start raping 'bout things
Like love and being true
Now maybe we could make another baby or 2

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good

This is DJ, Eazy Dick

On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new
By Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies
From all the guys

A big bow wow wow
'Cause we gonna make it a little mystery here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had a respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back

'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call

Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth

'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't do me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?

I have no love for hoes that's somethin' that I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe
Just to lay this hoe I know the pussy's mines
I'ma fuck a couple more times

And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who is back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
'Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo

What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well, once you're caught up with my grip

Now as the sun rotates
And my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy, I'm all the above

I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em

Whoa, hey, now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow

One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back

So back up bitch 'cause I'm strugglin'
So get off your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none",Rap

For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

La Di Da Di, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic, right

For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when ya cause a cozy condition
And which we create, 'cause that's our mission

So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens everyday
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin'
I gave myself a stretch up, a mornin' yawn

And went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said, â€½Umm, mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all?""

There was a rubble, dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""
Well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf

Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath

Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne

Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo

Then I dilly-dally, I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playin' hard to get
So I said, ""What's wrong?"", 'cause she looked upset

She said, â€½Umm it's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from meâ€

Damn, now what was I to do
She's cryin' over me and she was feelin' blue
I said, ""Umm, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""

Her mean mother steps then says to me, ""Hi""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete

The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin' was wrong I said, ""What was goin' on?""
I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either""

She grabbed my closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick

And sayin', â€½Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love todayâ€

Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, ""Cheer up"", so I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you, bitch""

She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts cryin'
I says, â€½I'm nineteenâ€, she says, ""Stop lyin'""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

Yeah, uhh, tic-toc you don't stop
And to the, ah tic-toc and you don't quit
Yeah, tic-toc and ya don't stop
And to the, ah tic-toc and ya don't quit

Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

I got the rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on

Uh! I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes, see these ice creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can excercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get a hizzead

Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit
Trying to ask me shit
When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four B
And think before you fuck with little skateboard P

Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crypt side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a D.J.
Two! one! yep, three!
S N double O P, D O double G

I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get lost!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes

Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now nigga, stop that!

Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to

Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin'  up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryin' to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang 'cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'

Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack

So put your gun away, run away, 'cuz I'm back
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up, now tell me what's goin' on
It make me wanna holler, 'cuz my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes

And quit tryin' to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cuz I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg

I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize and see where I'm comin' from
It's still East Side till I die, why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D O Double G Y

It's a crazy mixed up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Life Savors

Ain't that somethin', talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this nigga behind ya

So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets

It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows

I'm dishin' out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, French braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it

Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin'

Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin' out loony like O-Dog

It's a Doggy Dogg's World
The Dogg's World

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party uh huh
Tell when it don't stop, and uh, it don't quit for the
The Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavvy Dogg shit

Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin' that

Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about
The city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D O Double G the P O U N D, the gangsta clique

Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire*
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like ""What you mean Dogg?""
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
to a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit! [gun blasts]

Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playin' my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions
Nigga we don't know shit
Flexin', nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you
I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see 'em all finish

So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man

You owe me, you owe me

Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks, who else makin' rap albums
Doing numbers like it's pop? Same old pimp
Drake you know ain't nothing changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A. open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're textin', I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas trippin'
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizin' a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lackin' in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speakin' of lack of patience
Just me and my old man gettin' back to basics
We've been talkin' 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazin'
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just somethin' to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Lookin' like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for somethin' I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I lookin' for before?
Who you settlin' for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinkin' 'bout Texas, back when Porsha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexin', I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talkin' 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start tellin' me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowin' money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryin' to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feelin' like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were goin' through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learnin' the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m livin' I just hope I’m forgiven
It seem like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m actin' out in the open, it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I lookin' for before?
Who you settlin' for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck

[Verse 2]
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous
You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time

Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga, swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga...",Rap

""I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy""

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest,
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat
I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
‘Cause if we judging off your advances
I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do",Rap

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?

Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'

My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different

Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin' that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'

I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build to destroy

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone coming 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit""
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me something's gone wrong

You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings

And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up
Knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things

She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up

And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that
Shit the last 7 weekends

I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'

Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball.

Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now

Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it

No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playing with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinking back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance

My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop something crazy and I say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doing it the same, man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it""
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway 3 months later I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's something to do, yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same, dog",Rap

Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip Dapora and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoying yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought.",Rap

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over, but it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it

'Til it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on

Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back

[Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right

[Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[Bridge]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness

Ain't no question who we're about to kill

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me

Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't

You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes

The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!

Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this

All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave througAnnotateh the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where me accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well,
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L (Samuel Jackson)
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

[Chorus: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!

Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!

These girls ain't got nothing on you

Say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls, they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got

Obvious you're pretty, heard that you're a student
Working weekends in the city, trying to take you out, girl
Hope you're not too busy, and if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to

Put those fucking heels on and work it, girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice

You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice, you would shut it

Hey, oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Killa, killa

Girl, you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl, he's out his mind
You the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind

Hey baby
Every time you come around, shut down like computers
Hey lady
Step into my heart, let me put you into Louboutins

What you want? What you need?
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it

And together we shut it down, down, down
They know you shut it down, down, down
You be the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they notice, they notice

You would shut it down, down, down
You know you shut it down, down, down
Every time they come around, 'round, 'round
Well, all of them notice, they notice, you shut it down

MC Concrete Loop, you shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down, down, oh yeah
  (Yes, indeed, you shut it down, down, Drizzy, the American dream)

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, honest
No you not imagin' it, they lookin' at you, long stares
Even though she standin', now she look like she belongs here

You feel the hours pass until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she ain't got my heart beatin' double time

You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?

Damn, I mean, you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around
It's obvious

You shut that thing down, down, down
You shut it down, you shut it down
You shut it down, you shut it down
You shut it, oh, oh

You looking good girl
Go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl
Go, go, go, go, go, go

You looking good girl
Go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl
Go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down",Rap

From the concrete, who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin' it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit

Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
As you can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship

Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's on but it's lookin' like July four
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me

Damn, I kept my wits about me, luckily
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me

But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it

That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it, though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I see it in her eyes, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like

Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it

For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she sayin' she more lonely than ever before

How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me, where is the magic?

Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I wanna witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like",Rap

Automatic weapons on the floor but who can you call
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
Lot of quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Exotic red bottoms, so-bodied glittered in gold
Following fundamentals Im following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow is on the menu

Need a new safe cause Im runnin out of space

I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me? Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty

Walkin' 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, yo ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty winin' 'round all these Jamaicans

But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, aye yo we made it, Thanksgiving
So aye, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

Cause I ain't got the money on me right now

Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant ain't it
That's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that

This the greatest shit in the club since In Da Club
It's so packed I might ride around
With no bodyguard back like Prince in the club
She say ""Can you get my friends in the club?""
I say ""Can you get my Benz in the club?""
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago

It may just sound all whack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo

Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fucking Yeezy in Serrato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)

Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a nice flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the king of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students

And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me

The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why you're Winslow

Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
I saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron

And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high

Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Less talk, more head right now, huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And about to take it to another level, bitch

None of who you goin' get, ain't nobody as cold as this
Do the rap and attract triple double no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit

I heard the beat, the same rap's will the track, man
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act
And short nigga but these ho's love my accent

She came up to me and said this the number two gal
If you want to make it number one, you're number two now
This the Goose and Malibu, I call it MaliBOO-YAH

Know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Not gonna do us, it's new now
Think you motherfucker really, really  need to cool out

'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mami best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Now she claimin' that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want to swallow shit

None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen

I kill a block, I murder the avenues
Rape and pillage your village, women and children

All I get are these vampires and blood suckers
All I see are these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelin's in the air

As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

On a bathroom wall I wrote
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it, like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else

Fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
'TIl about two am and I call back and I hang up
And I start to blame myself, somebody help

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking, and choking you

What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you
Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?

You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like what was I supposed to do?

Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers

I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy, I ain't your right, girl
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls

All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies

We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity, we erased one another
So far from where we came with so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?

Lack of visual empathy
Equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

An' I know that you were smilin' when you seen the car I bought her
An' you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up

But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo Must Die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to bein' true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no you'll never let me down

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

We're all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world

I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical

I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental

Vibrations is what I'm into, yeah, I need my lubarinde
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryin' 'Give us us free' like sinkay
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot

Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talkin' to you, my many inspirations
When I say it I can't, let you or self down

If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest rift
And you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down

And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love, that's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme

So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God rains out, take 'em to church

When it comes to bein' true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
I know you'll never let me down

Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long?
Started from nothin' but he got this strong
Picked the rock from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddle bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special

Let you tell that man I thought it, well, somebody must've taught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I light the Mike Jord' in 'em
Number one albums, what? I got, like, four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way

Clear the way, I'm here to stay, y'all can save the chitter chat
""This an' that"", ""This an' Jay"", this an' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spittin' them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys please, Father, forgive us

Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend an' I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov an' Hov's still alive

Slow jamming having deep sex<br />

214,Kanye West,http://www.songlyrics.com/kanye-west/gone-lyrics/,"Wished I had told
Ooh was the only one
But it's too late, too late
She's gone

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin' 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay

Brother Numpsay, groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says, she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Gone, we strivin' home
Gone, we ride on chrome
It's too late

Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to let it burn

Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, """"*****, it's yo' turn""
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official

R-R-Roc Pastille with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now
He at the top with doobie long
'Cause the dookie's on any song
That they threw me on

Gone, we strivin' home
Gone, I ride on chrome
Gone, we strivin' home
We strivin' home
Gone, I ride on chrome

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh, my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer?
Well here's the deal ma we goin' to the dealer booth

No concealin', no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, ****** still doin' puff puff pass

Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, Jag
Y'all *****z want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em

Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say

Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church boy actin' like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin' my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi

And that ain't leavin' alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask Georgia or Regina
The whole West side I explore with the Beamer now

We strivin' home
I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
'Cause

Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin' out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on

But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on?
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta gone to the feds

So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks

But lookin' back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented 'Gone with the Wind', 'cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a ***** talkin' ***t so I had gone to the car

And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh onn, uh uh uh onn
Uh uh onn, uh uh uh I'mmm

Ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house

Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin' it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light, like, when I was on the grind
In the one, nine, nine, nine

Before model chicks was bendin' over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-a** sofa

What the summer of the Chi got to offer a 18 year old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros

Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirror
How we out in Europe, spendin' Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on

I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin' the mannequin
They got a new ***ch, now you Jennifer Aniston

Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorty's at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry, Mr. West is gone",Rap

We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan

I mean a nigga did a lot of waitin'
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the God's be with us
And that magic hour I seen good Christians make rash decisions

Oh she do it, what happened to religion?
Oh she lose it, she putting on her make up
She casually allure, text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more

I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a Jumbotron
I'm lookin' at her like, ""This what you really want it, huh?""

Why you standin' there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us

I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said, ""You are what you eat""
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was

The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evenin'
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' RosÃ© all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own

Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired

Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag

Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport

New Mercedes Sedan, they'll export
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne

Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over

I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die, you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches

Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's
The Hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil' so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me

A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I've become
CNN said I'll be dead by twenty-one

Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith

Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them ho's coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't

I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness

I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more

Them kilo's came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places, the favorite

My cup overruneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn it's hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment: thou should not hate, kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David

Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothin' like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march

Damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the two's nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart

G-A-T in the path finder
'Cause you haters got PhD's
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

Hey yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous

Cars for the misses and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous

Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous",Rap

I'm tryin' to catch the beat
I'm tryin' to catch the beat
I'm tryin' to catch the beat

Now, throw ya motherfuckin' hands
Get em high
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin' man
Get em high
Now, I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
Keep em high
And if ya losin' yo high then smoke again
Keep em high

Now, my flow is in the pocket like Wallace
I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was goin' through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college

My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts to the plaques or the stacks""
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?

I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't usually smoke but pass the dro

And I won't give you that money that you askin' fo'
Why you think me and dame cool? We assholes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
'Cuz we don't wanna here that weak shit no mo'

Now, throw ya motherfuckin' hands
Get em high
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin' man
Get em high
Now, I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
Keep em high
And if ya losin' yo high then smoke again
Keep em high

Now who the hell is this?
E-mailin' me at 11:26, tellin' me
That she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be
When they get bubblee

At NYU but she hailed from Kansas
Right now she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis

W-H-I-T, it's gettin' late mami
Your screen saver say tweet so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend his name Kweli
You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib
I mean that's my favorite CD that I play at my crib

I mean you don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time and get her high

I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind I need some tracks you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fittin' to blow you, tryin' to blow backs out
Well okay you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyo
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with yo moms?

And she's the bomb, boy, she got the bougey behavior
Always got somethin' to say like a okayplaya hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the interneter

Chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicolette
You really fuckin' that much, you tryin' to get off cigarettes
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble cushion, a sister could get a hit of it

Get em high like noon or the moon
Or room filled with smoke, a high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed out of tune
But I still feel the notes the real nigga quotes

Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control, rap is not a
Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods
In the hood to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you
You'se a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you

How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say Hip-Hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys

To many featured emcees and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and snooped up

Label got you souped up, tellin' you, you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster

Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder than Denver I ain't a mad rapper
Just a emcee with a temper

You dancin' for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survived like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

Now, throw ya motherfuckin' hands
Get em high
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin' man
Get em high
Now, I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
Keep em high
And if ya losin' yo high then smoke again

Hide til its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Rick Ross:]
Bitch I’m a monster no good blood sucker
Fat muthafucker now look who’s in trouble
As you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, here’s one for example

[Chorus: ~Kanye West~]
Gossip gossip
Niggas just stop it
Everybody know (I’m a muthafucking monster)
I’ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I’ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I’m a muthafucking monster
I’ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I’ma need to see your fucking hands at the ...

The best living or dead hands down huh?
Less talk more head right now huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I’m bout to take it to another level bitch
There you go again, aint nobody as cold as this
Do the rap and the track triple double no assist
But my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
She came up to me and said this the number 2
If you wanna make it number one your number 2 now
This that goose an’ malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy How I hit em with the new style
Know that muthafucker well, what you gon do now
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
Nah gonna do, uhh its a new now
Think yo muthafucker really really need to cool down
Cause you will never get on top off this
So mommy best advice is to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharoah
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I’m living the future so the presence is my past
My presence is a present kiss my ass

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question what do all these things have in common
Everybody knows I’m a muthafucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
None of you niggas know where the swamp is
none of you niggas have seen the carnage that I’ve seen
I still here fiends scream in my dream

I kill a block I murder avenues
rape and pillage a village, women and children
everybody wanna know what my achilles heel is
LOVE I dont get enough of it

all I see is these niggas I’ve made millionnaires
milling about, spilling there feelings in the air

tryna draw blood with my ice cold veins

If we could buy time, I spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in a blind
This little light of mine, I'm a let it shine

My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?

I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two Gs

But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh, you so boozy, boo, you could've fooled me
'Cuz five years ago, you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs

You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell but not Nokia

It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery, ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda
Then I'ma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade?

Malik Yusef, bet your baby, momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words, spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames

Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go

I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you, fuck it
Now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to?

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade?

Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends

Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife, stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks

Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor

The sex is good but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction, so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways
Goin' wild like West and Kanye

Wherever I lay my [unverified] is my home
Goddamnit, I'm grown
Broke broad, I'ma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

Yeah, fly the broads, fly the dogs down to Atlanta
Yeah, in the cut in Medusa, lay low, yeah, I might be
Yeah, roll up, help me calm down when I'm movin' high speed
Yeah, If I send one, need the text back 'cause you know what I need
Oh, please (oh please)

I'm rolling high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights please

What the fuck they want?
I'm drunk as hell, fuck work today
I wanna get some tail, damn my little nigga graduated
Man I wish him well, now there's no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales!
Step across that fence, and thats your life
When I run that town, That whip about town size
4 Chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice
You think something wrong cause your shit don't shine bright
But ain't nothing wrong because your shit don't shine bright!

It was Friday, what a night what a situation
My nigga chase momma called cause he missed that graduation
He told her momma please, have a drink have a little bit patience
Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation
Pastor said that we gotta move to congregation
I'm looking for salvation but I'm drowning in the revelations

No matter what time the skies are grey
The sky is grey

Around this time, was starvin no Ramadan
Mighta robbed you blind
You, you, you, your dad and moms
Yea, keep that in mind
Fear 2 things being broke and dying
Jump your ass inside, LSD come take this ride
No AC, ID, how you get your ass inside
Good, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind

Who knew a threeway on freeway can trip with three hoes to a sixway
Ain't gotta finness out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that bengay
No more, goddamn
And pops never gave me shit
But pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside like it ain't that serious

Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick

In your club, on your couch, just got paid to be here
On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us, only wanted of Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house

Around 3 AM dog, I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami heater
Put it in a two seater, too bad I couldn't three peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
With more stamps than a skinny nigga got tats on my Visa
I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it

Sloppy toppy, you can't touch my wallet

Know that my wristwatch is sloppy
Now they want a double dutch in my pockets
Tell me one thing, is she 'bout it?
Girl is you 'bout it?
Gotta know before we let you tip toe and run through the lobby
But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby
So she got me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy Goddess
Over the garden, over the garden
Oh what a goddess
On my privates, we don't do massages
Just menages
She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it
She don't tap out, no tap out, she rather just black out
Then we take trips to her trap house
We been pullin' them stacks out
Call over your friends
Bend over, they poppin' for bands
Can't stop if I can
No I do not do beer cans, fuck is this a frat house?

I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it
I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it

I pull up and pick her up
Get her bruh
I know that she bad
And I know that the head is so good when she got around
I know that we call her the sloppy toppy
My pockets so sloppy
I pull out the whopper, the chopper
Just know that's who shot ya
Me, pull up in that 'Rari I don't have a key
She hop in the whip, disappear like a genie

She got the sloppy toppy, bitches want my broccoli
She after my money, Monopoly
I make 'em swallow me then kick 'em off of my property
Paparazzi keep on stalkin' me
Feel like the Federali's keep on watchin' me
Worth 100 mil, niggas can't talk to me
Get sloppy toppy but you givin' currency
I make your bitch work for me, she at the Doubletree
Chopping strong, OG gas bags of that Hercules
Whipping the top off the Audi, do surgery
Red on the bottom, my shoes it's a murder scene
I don't want your bitch she a natnat
Pull up in the Audi, it's a hatchback
Kickin', pimpin' and I'm luxury livin'
Makin' it disappear, I'm a magician

Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it, I know that she got it, I know that she got it
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it, I know that she got it, I know that she got it

Sloppy in the wrist and all my pockets
Come here lil bitch, I want sloppy toppy
Butt naked, fuckin' in Balenciaga
Her pussy wet, I call it Fiji water
I know she got it, I'ma beat it for her
Then I dismiss the bitch and ignore her
They know I got it, I'm at the top floor
With Benjamins on me, no dubs
Duffle bag filled up like I'm Money Mayweather
Boogers in my Rollie, Pikachu yellow
Pick a shoe, Balenci, Maison Margiela
Pick a big bezel, which bezel is better?
My jeweler know I got big cheddar
Double Lambo, double parking wherever
Double R ghost jump out with an umbrella
Come with me, we take off like space shuttles

Sloppy toppy in the Maserati
She gone get on top me, ride me like a Harley
I don't fuck with the molly, look at her body
She a hottie like a bag of Takis
Beat the pussy like I'm Pacquiao
Squeeze the nipples like you milk a cow
Pull up in the car that she can't pronounce
Dick in her mouth, you'd think she got a root canal
30 thousand for her Birkin
Fat booty, shawty perfect
She gag on the dick and she burpin'
She swallow my kids like a slurpee
Good brains, she nerdy
I'm wonderin' what is her purpose
When I get around her I get nervous
Little momma, she clean like detergent

It's still Dre Day Nigga, A.K Nigga
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? My last album was ""The Chronic""
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on pace

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho')

Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
No deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No books, no snowmobiles and no ski's

Mad at me 'cause
I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques

Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'm let my dough freeze?
Hoe please, you better bow down on both knees

Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And the group that said mother, ""Fuck the police""

Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doctor they told you to go, see

Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or the the Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me

And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
Then study a tape of N.W.A.!

One day I was walkin' by with a Walkman on
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage

Hopin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you too and them loud ass muthafuckin' barkin dogs

And when them cops came through me
And Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
Right here

From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today, tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew

Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's

Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with them, Hailey

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

If it was upto me
You muthafuckas would stop comin' upto me
With your hands out lookin' upto me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of

I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around, talking about guns
Like I ain't got none

What you think, I sold 'em all 'cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off

I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back

So where's all the Madd Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
When you were cuddling a cabbage patch

Keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
Uh yeah

Hey you sittin' over there, say what?
You better get up outta your chair, that's right
And work your body down, yeah
No time to funk around cuz we gon'

Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E, the spectacula
Interparty I go for your neck so call me Blackula

As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains
So don't complain, just chill
Listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real enables me to make another meal

Still niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple
So call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the earth
Since birth I've been a bad nigga
Now let me tell ya what I'm worth

More than a stealth bomba
I cause drama, the enforcer
Music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet

The mike gets smoked
Once you hear the beat kicked
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flava that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E
I keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong

One two, for the crew
Three four, for the dough
Five, for the hoes
Six seven eight, for Death Row

Mad niggas 'bout to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I'm fend to get into my men too
And take care of this business
I need to attend to, â€~cuz my rent's due

And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'ma kick it
Or get evicted

I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin' niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot wit the flava I got
I get plenty of ass, call me an ass-tronaut

As I blast past another nigga's ass who thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow niggas know it's time to take a hike
â€~Cuz I grab the mike and flip my tongue like a dike

I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green
And keep your eyes slanted
So check the flava that I'm bringin'
The mothafunkin' D-R-E
A keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
Yeah, c'mon

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Debonair with flair I scare wear and tear
Without a care, runnin' shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin' all opposition to see a mortician

I'm up front, never in the back drop
I step on stage and get faded like a flattop
Your rhyme sounds like you bought â€~em at Stop-n-go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop-n-glo

Many try to, but just can't ride wit
I'm six one, two twenty-five of pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin' me are slim G
â€~Cuz I rock from summer â€~til Santa comes down the chimney

Hoe hoe hoe and so as I continue to flow
â€~Cuz yo, I'm just a fly negro so
Check the flava that I'm bringin'
The mothafuckin' D-R-E
A keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
I keep their motherfuckin heads ringin'
Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
I keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong
I keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong

  (Yeah, uhh, c'mon)
If you, want to, get on down
  (Yeah, Death Row back up in that ass)
You gotta get on down
  (For the one-nine-nine to the nickel)
Just get on down
  (So all you motherfuckers out there tryin' to get with this?)
  (Don't even try it)

If you, want to, get on down
  (You couldn't see us with binoculars, can you dig it?)
You gotta get on down
  (Yeah, uhh, I know you're bobbin' your head)
Just get on down

'Cause I can see you
Uhh, I know you're bobbin' your head

Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E (Nah, Nah, Nigga Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day Nigga, A.K Nigga
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? My last album was ""The Chronic""
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on pace

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho')
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life)
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost a friend
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs

255,Dr Dre,http://www.songlyrics.com/dr-dre/i-need-a-doctor-lyrics/,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday it's just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's whack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathing life in me, I owe my life to you
but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
See this light in you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight me
When I get off this fucking mic or you gon' hug me
But I'm not an option, there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy but you're either getting lazy
Or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre
I'm crying in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life, bring me back to life, bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room, cracked jokes
But once you got inside the booth, told you like smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass

Little crackerjack beat, making wack mass
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor

But I been low key, hated on by most these niggas
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's

Mad at me 'cause, I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies

But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze, ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the o' G's?

Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, ""Muthafuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats

The bomb weed stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Ya'll better listen up closely

All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the firm flop, ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So, fuck ya'll, all of ya'll, if ya'll don't like me, blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA

One day I was walkin' by wit a walkman on
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not

I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge but I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out wit two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops

I'ma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches and still one found out

From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco and nutsto choke you to death wit a Charleston chew
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up

And the temp goes up to the mid 80's, callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me, you muthafuckas would stop comin' up to me
Wit your hands out lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of, I told 'em all
All them little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?

Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all?
'Cause I stay well off, now, all I get is hate mail all day
Sayin', Dre fell off, what 'cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off

I ain't havin' that, this is the millenium of aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back

So, where's all the mad rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddled wit cabbage patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

Used to be my homey, used to be my ace

Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide

Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the Eazyest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc

And pass the bud, and stay low-key
B.G. 'cause you lost all your homey's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck wit you

I heard she was the 'Frisco Dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talkin' about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M U T

So you wanna pop that shit get yo motherfuckin' cranium cracked nigga
Step on up, now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D R, yeah, motherfucker

Now understand this my nigga Dre can't be touched

Musta, thought I was sleazy
Or though I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy

Animosity, made ya speak but ya spoke
Ay yo Dre, whattup, check this nigga off loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots ta fuck with
Gap teeth in ya mouth so my dick's gots to fit

With my nuts on ya tonsils
While ya on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concerts
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
To show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride

Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gon' creep to South Central
On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple

Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

Fuck a bitch, don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch, gobble the dick

Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention hoes for a dollar

Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimpin' hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggaz paid for hoes just to lay wit' hoes
Relax one night and paid to stay wit' hoes
Captain save 'em, all day, bitch well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin' pussy, or hittin' the switch
You into hittin' bitches off of the grip, you punk bitch

All my down hoes still trickin' wit' me
All the true gangstas know

All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin' for me
All the real smokers know

Before, I blew yo' mind
(Blew-blew-blew your mind)
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on

Here baby, hit the bong
While the west coast rolls along
While we, still makin' gangsta hits
You'll be, still jockin' gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you slick
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

I got these freaky hoes, clappin' they hands, stompin' they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimpin' bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Lemme drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave ya boy the head and said don't let nobody know

A bona fide pro, I had to grab the hoe
She got freaky in yo' sixty-fo', I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the hoe for fo' days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mall
They be beepin' me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiendin', they on the nuts

Forgot About Dre (Video Version)
Dr. Dre:
Y'all know me
Still same ol' G
But I've been low key
Hated on by most these {niggas} with no cheese
No deals and no keys
No wheels and no G's
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me cuz I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib full of studio when it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in the back of my house like trophies
But y'all think I'ma let my dog freeze
{Ho} please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke {trees}?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C.'s and Snoop D.O. Double G's
And the group that said {mother-Fuck} Tha Police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
The bomb weed stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales it wasn't doin to good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you {niggas} that said that I turned pop
Or the firm flop
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
So {fuck} y'all
All y'all
If y'all don't like me, {blow} me
Y'all gon' keep {fucking} around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Eminem:
So what do you say to somebody you hate?
Or anyone tryna bring trouble in your way
Wanna resolve things in a {bloodier} way?
Just study your tape of N.W.A.
One day I was walking by with a walkman on
When I caught a guy giving me an awkward eye
Till I {strangled} him off in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a {fuck} if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage

Well, I know you! You are ruining my sleep and my ??
this is a shame. I say stop do that, it's embarrasing. You

you can see here... (My god, my god!) (She'll be allright)
And this gentleman you seems to have upseeded all happen...
Can you tell me your name sir?
Eminem:
Yeah, all I now is I'm upstairs,and i'm listenin to my Will Smith C.D.       
And I see all thse flames going everywhere. You no what I'm sayin.
Hey, hold on a minute {bitch}! Yo... hold on a minute.

Eminem:
And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a {can full of gas} and a {hand full of matches}
And still no one found out (right here)

Starting today, and tomorrows the new
But I'm still loco and nuts to choke you to {death} with a Charleston chew

Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up

Callin men ladies
Sorry doc but I've been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie

Dr. Dre:
If it was up to me, you {muh'fuckas} would stop comin up to me
With you hands out lookin up to me like it was something free
When my last CD was out you weren't bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some desease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cuz I'm from the streets of ({Fucking} Compton)

Cuz I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What, cuz I've been in the lab

Aww they say uhh..

Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
on planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her,
""Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!""
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But +I'm+ the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player! 

Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
but you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
you went and got pregant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
cause that nigga ain't shit.""
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
that yo' momma, you was a hoe!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
that's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
cause he take care of his REAL family

Times is changing, young niggas is agin'
Becoming old gees in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces, but

The strangest things can happen from rappin', when
Niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it

I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em up high, and suddenly watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough

Best friends and money, I lost them both
Went, visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show
  (The watcher)

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
  (The watcher)
People I used to know just don't know me no more
  (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go I got people I know
  (The watcher)
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low
  (I watch)

I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas ain't made me if niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach

How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much Tupac in you, you got

I ain't no bitch neither, it's either my life or your life
I ain't leaving, I like breathing
Nigga we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, for pound for pound

Nigga if you really want to take it there we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes
  (The watcher)

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before

People I used to know just don't know me no more

But everywhere that I go I got people I know

Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low
  (I watch)

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead and enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in

Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers

But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us, now callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us

Nigga we started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just havin' fun, just watchin' it fly by

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before

People I used to know just don't know me no more

East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash

Lovers it curves so freak what you heard

Rollin with the fatness

Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the o' G's
Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said muthafuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop 
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin around wit me
And turn me back to the old me 

[chorus] x2 [Eminem] 

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre 

[Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA.
One day I was walkin by 
Wit a walkmen on
When I caught a guy givin me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage 
Hoppin out wit two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still one found out
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin today and tomorrows the new
And I'm still loco and nuts 
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew 

Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies 
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up 
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's ok go with him Hailey 

[chorus] x2 

[Dr Dre]
If it was up to me
You muthafuckas would stop comin up to me 
Wit your hands out lookin up to me
Like you want somethin free
When my last cd was out you wasn't bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of
I told em all 
All them little gangstas 
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off 
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddled wit cabbage patch

You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? My last album was ""The Chronic""
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho')

Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

Laid back in the shack, play this track

Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

A message to God

Since you finishin' 'em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow, later we'll regret till death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those made to be taken away from each other
Now, what I'm supposed to do, I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us
So with all due respect, you could'a forgave him
You didn't have to take him

He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin' like my whole world is blinded, wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We could'a used time spent arguin', tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more, seein' him leave, or watchin' him go

Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Listen, listen)
Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

If you wonder why
(Why I live my life)
The way that I do
('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me
('Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday
Runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packin' heat up there
Met up with homies from the street and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin' through it with you
We lost a thug, a son and a father
I spoke to your son the other day and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pullin' your file
'Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial

Prayin' you get it but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit or you gon' play it like you get it
I have been through all emotions, from in shock to keepin' a poker face
To straight breakin' down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believin' real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin' I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me but you know I'ma always ride with you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Listen, listen)
Listen, listen, listen, oh
Listen, listen, listen

If you wonder why

If you don't know why
You better listen up right now
Listen, listen, listen, listen, ohh
Listen, listen, yeah yeah yeah

Listen, listen, children, listen

Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha?

You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soul mate

Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it! Yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hit the Man hit it; damn bitches

Man, this is what I'm talkin' about
Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place

You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I cum quick, help you re-decorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin' too far, I take it out and wipe it off

And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him the new trick of
How you can make it smoke a cancer stick

You be workin' it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time, that you want
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin' diggin' through some records instead

But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook-up somewhere and exchange some fuck faces
I know your man's lookin' for ya, he's always tryin to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffin' girl cause I just wanna fuck witchu
Fuck witchu

On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, ya freak bitch?
You, actin', like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with

""Baby was a virgin"" that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then lil' half dead put his dick on her head

Take that bitch home, and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Man, she blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her

Somethin' to go by, and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out

We servin' these hoes, and never lovin' these hoes, beotch!

Pack a vest for your Jimmy, in the city of sex

We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money makin' machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' sassoon

So I'm startin' with the man in the

Mirror on the wall
(MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
(Take 'em to Mars, man)

You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talkin' to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
(Any questions?)

You told me that they can
(I come to you)
Understand the man I am
(You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talkin' to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Ay BP
Looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we talkin' to each other again?",Rap

Six, six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the F is for Finisher

So misunderstood but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch but I fuck her like I missed her

Life is the bitch and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture

You know Father Time and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation

Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil' Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Yeah, I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes so I couldn't blame Tammy

Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end

Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt

Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off

Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder

You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals then I'ma have a mink soon

Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money

Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta, kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her

You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder

Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend

I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda

Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer hoe, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter

Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind

I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
'Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside

 I tell her ""now goin pop that pussy for a real nigga
 I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
 Niggas is jealous but really I couldn't care less
 I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net
 Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
 So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
 What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
 Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
 Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
 I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
 Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
 And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
 I rock to the beat of my drumset
 I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
 But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
 Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

[Drake:]
 She just started to pop it for a nigga
 And look back and tell me ""baby, it's real""
 And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
 I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
 I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
 And she bad, so maybe she won't
 Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
 Yeah,

 Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
 She will, yeah
 Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
 She will, she will, she will
 Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
 She will, she will, she will
 Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
 She will, she will, she will

 Yeah, I tell her ""now go on, pop that pussy for me""
 Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
 And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
 Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
 Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
 I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
 I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
 Eat her til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
 Try to check me and I'm a have 'em checkin' pulses
 They sya chose wisely, that's why I was chosen
 Rocking like asphalt, it's the cash fault
 Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
 Now I like my house big and my grass soft
 I like my girl face South and her ass North
 But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
 Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

 She just started to pop it for a nigga
 And look back and tell me ""baby, it's real""

Young Money, Cash Money
This is DA Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemen, you know me

Listen, you know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'ma hustler and I'd rather make a killin'

My eyes is so wide as he watchin' the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck ya hospital, Young Money, we the illest

And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty like CY Phyllis
Self made G and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap but in the kitchen I'm a chemist

And when I was 5, my favorite movie was the gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and the little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission

I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing

And you know that I'ma ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit

And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
'Coz the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you see that I'm goin' be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck Ten in the coupe and your bitch love it
Switching lane faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free

And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Coz I'm the type to let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea

The only thing on a mind of a shark is eat by any means
And you're just sardines
I got the 40 cal tuck in my P.R.Ps
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans

And majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours

And I'ma ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit

And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm goin' be in it
'Coz the sky is the limit

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off ya shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone
That's sitting on the living room sofa
(That's fucked up, haha)

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off ya shoulder
Mail it to your mom wit a dozen of roses
(Now that's fucked up)

And I'm a G
And you ain't gotta know the alphabets to see
I know that my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I could never forget the streets

So, you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah, the sky is the limit
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm goin' be in it
'Coz the sky is the limit

They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em I'ma hustler and I'd rather make a killin'

Hands up in the air because the sky is the limit

And I make her feel special like a place kicker

She wanna be Weezy F babysitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold on, she say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand

Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
Its 'bout to get nasty, pork rinds

She came hard both times
We both say we single and we both lying
We both wrong but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino

This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path but got on different shoes
Live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down the road
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find the pole
Plus I be sipping so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl that tell a friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes, I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussy, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my Advance in Advance, Amen

I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yea, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Do it big and let the small fall under that

Roll up and cock it, and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid get your head popped
I got that Esther, bitch, I'm Red Fox
Big B's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks

You're fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip, then roll the window up
Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she say she finnin' cum

Two hundred thou' on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, Y-M-C-M-B

Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see you looking with your looking ass nigga
You don't know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I die today, it'd be a holiday

I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
So don't make it come alive
Rip your ass apart, then I put myself together
Y-M-C-M-B, Double M, we rich forever

The bigger the bullet, the more that bitch going to bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini 'til I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papa gave me forty bricks

Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny, mama? Only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather around, got gifts for each and all of y'all

Take it home and let it bubble, that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, yeah",Rap

Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggaz heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes, they wanna fuck

But homie ain't nuttin' changed hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp

In the hood, in L.A. they sayin,""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggaz'll tell ya, I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga, I done came up, and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?

When my joint get to pumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she's gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin about money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'ma tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggaz hate then let 'em hate then watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside your head wit a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither nigga
We in the club all the time nigga, it's about to pop off nigga

Uh-huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out 'My Melody'""

I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope

Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggaz had stolen my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I told Dre from the gate ""I'd carry the heat for ya""
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers

At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin', ""Free Yayo""
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine

And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend

And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change it's stayin' the same

How many of them boys is witcha'?
When you had that little TV, you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud

My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat

Now I'm speedin', reminiscin', holdin' my weed in
Never listen if I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose

Sippin, 'Easy Jesus', rockin' a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good

Let me show you what a thug 'bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need

And I'm sellin' them for 500 a pop god damn it

I sell anythin' I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook
And what goes on in my mind

It's contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Be gettin' money man

It's a hustler's ambition
Close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin' and drama means nothin'
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin' lanes
Or in the jeweler's switchin' chains

I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curve and get nauseous, watchin' the spinner spin

I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo' ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender and make a protein shake

I'm like the east coast number one Playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The Feds watch me, Icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin' at me, ""Look at Niggerace""

You are now rapping with 50 cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love fuck me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love fuck me?
Girl

If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside?
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love fuck me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love fuck me?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love fuck me?

All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show you how I live in a lil bit

I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and fuckin' a lil bit

Baby, you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show you how I live in a lil bit

I, I owe you for this one

I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah!
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's Fifty!
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah!
If you thinking I'm a fuckin' fall off ya so wrong, it's Fifty!

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sittin' politic with passengers from nine eleven
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine

God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at yo dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
Fifty fear no man, Warrior, swingin' swords like Conan

Picture me, pen in hand writin' lines knowin' the Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?

In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot, today my phone will stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah!
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's Fifty!

If ya patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They think they crazy but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit basically they just playin' sick
They ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' wit me?

Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose wit this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin' you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?

Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not

It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot

Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers, there's nothin' spookier
Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin' Fifty

I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah!
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's Fifty!
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah!
If you thinking I'm a fuckin' fall off ya so wrong, it's Fifty!

If the gun spark I'll hear all of the shots go off
It's Fifty, they say it's Fifty
See a nigga layed out wit his fuckin' top blown off
It's Fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth
'Cause I'll break yo face
Have yo ass runnin' mumblin' to the jake

You goin' against me dog, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper

Yo bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety four, we don't love them hoes

I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood, they filled up wit holes motherfucker

I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah!
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's Fifty!

Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You getting money?

I can't get none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the Coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit them they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it, the mack I blast it

D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Chokes me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard

When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime

I'm like Patti Labelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a Rolling Stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches

Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right

Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang""

She can bring the lingerie with her, I suppose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mayne

Listen mayne, **** changed, I came up I'm doin' my thang
Homey I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'

Come through with black mags
And have niggas zip up them black bags

I apply pressure to niggas until they fold
But never mind me, man, that's just how I be

The game got me trained
They call me the hustle Mayne
And like Fame, my style'll live forever
They thought I crossed over
'Cause they don't know no better

I think they think I'm laxed now
'Cause I got the cheddar
Till I have a turned back
Bustin' trust me it's nothin'

Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk

A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her

She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head

And niggaz trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse One]
Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus - singing]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse Two]
Some days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

Y'all niggas is pussy
I'm ballin' now nigga now watch me
(Watch me)
Ain't nothin' you can do to stop me
(Stop me)
You niggas get so emotional
(Emotional)

You remind me of my bitch
It's not in my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
But she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her
(Leave her)
Like being on probation makin' it harder for me to except her

As my own, she tries to tie up my phone and
(Phone and)
I'm not at home, she's thinkin' that I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anythin' in the street
I let her know she can leave, I ain't tryin' to tie her up but see

It's hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me mami
I'm not your regular nigga, I know the game
(I know the game)
But I don't play by the rules
I'm focusin' on my moves that way I'll never lose
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benz's with 22's

Say, I confuse, you play little tricks with your head
Catchin' feelin's ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you, mislead you or mess up your dreams
(Nah)
I can't say I love you, I don't know what that means, I'ma pimp

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking extasy

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking extasy

When I first met her, I did anything to get her
(What?)
Paid all her bills and filled the 'fridgerator
Reminiscin' on late nights when I try to lay up
But couldn't get off, 'cause your baby would stay up

She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writin' her baby pops in the box in the prison
Sing-sing is where he biddin'

She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil
Motor bike and grams of fish scale
It's a nine to five niggas with no frills

Turnin' young niggas with princables to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch had the best sex all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking extasy

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking extasy

I'm wonderin' when I'm gone if you'll miss me
(Miss me)
Or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy
I'm fuckin' with you
I'm feelin' your shape, I'm feelin' your eyes
Later on I'm feelin' your ass and feelin' your thighs
(Come here, baby)

Sweet heart you're book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
(Yeah)
I'm into tongue kissin' and four play all day
Mama ain't home so the noise is okay

O.D.B you know he like it the raw way
Latex safe sex no hickeys on the neck
Now you learnin'
The Lords blessin' makes me wiser as the world's turnin'
My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin'

Whether we're just kickin' it or sexin', I'm a pro, baby girl
I spit game to perfection
(Yeah)
So when niggas make mistakes I correct them
And when niggas get out of line I check them man

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking extasy

Girl, you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock

Yeah, don't think I forgot about your fat ass though Irv
Runnin' around, takin' pictures
Like you Puff Daddy and the family, mothafucka
And that bitch Charli Baltimore

Bitch look like she died last week pale as fuck
Paint her hair red think she gone sell records
Tryin' to impersonate Pink and shit bitch
Punk ass mothafuckas

All you mothafuckas get wrote on nigga
Ain't no mothafuckas leave her alone
'Cause she a bitch fuck that nigga
Fuck all of it but not you Ashanti, baby
You know how I feel about you, baby

Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps

The drama really means nothing to me

Sayin', ""Lord, Jesus help me"" â€~cuz they ass leakin'
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya ill handgun until you run out

But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side, shit I'm aight wit that

Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks

I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today
I'm happy how my life turned out

See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now, shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help

I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin' to get get shot it won't do 'em no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin' hurt when it rains

Oh you a pro at playin' battleship well this ain't the same

She asking God, what my baby dunn did now?

I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow

I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault

Next time you in the hood and see an ol' G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

The record is all fucked up now, what we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around
That's Ja's lil punk ass stickin' out loud
Southside, tie-dyed, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggaz, they come from Yonkers

It's been years and you had the same niggaz in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah's crack child
Them niggaz they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say ""They like them in the hood""
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys sayin' ""50 we feelin' you mayn""
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy bad guy

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an ol' G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

I ain't tellin' anyone you pussy
I ain't tellin' anyone you gettin' extored
It ain't over G-Unit
I've been patently waitin' to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 50 cent show
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep
I'm a nightmare huh
You hired cops to hold you down 'cuz you fear for your life
You heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't goin' nowhere, I done told you nigga
I'ma G-Unit motherfuckin' solider nigga they not gon' like you
I know, I know ha, ha G-Unit

Oh no he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, ok? Jeffery Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla!
Now everythang was cool, until, 50 Cent, came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffery!
Ok first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pinkbelt
Okay I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay 'cuz see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I thought so
'Cuz you know that I know karate, and I will see him
And I will ""Jet Li"" his ass!

You steal the food right out of my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Ohhh
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much

It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code

But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Keep the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice

 Yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in TriBeCa
 right next to Deniro, but I'll be hood forever
 I'm the new Sinatra, and... since I made it here
 I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere
 I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
 right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
 Took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
 catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them Pastry's
 Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
 drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
 Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
 now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
 Say what's up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
 sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
 Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from....

 New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
 There's nothin' you can't do
 Now you're in New York
 These streets will make you feel brand new
 Big lights will inspire you
 Let's hear it for New York, New York,

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
 You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
 but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
 Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
 Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
 for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
 8 million stories, out there in it naked
 City, it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
 Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
 If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
 Three dice cee-lo, three Card Monty
 Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
 Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
 Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
 so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
 lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
 then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
 Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
 City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
 The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

[Chorus:]

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
 One hand in the air for the big city
 Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
 No place in the world that could compare
 Put your lighters in the air

Take it from the top

Now I just wanna love you, you know I love you

And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them

Drunk off Crist', Mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all""

It gets better, ordered another round
It's about to go down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'm a go
How, much I'm a spend but you already know

Zip, zero, stingy with Dinero
Might buy you Crist' but that about it
I might light your Crist' but that about it

Okay, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me

Now give it to me

I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know
It ain't where I been, but where I'm 'bout to go

Now I just wanna love you
But be who I am
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Romancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin

Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me

Now give it to me

 Have a little fun with it

 Hey nobody dumpin' on hove
You ain’t in sanitation or sanitarium
 What are you crazy Jay-Z’ll bury em
 I'll get you drug out the club they have to carry em
 Your head bug out I'll raid niggas scared of em
 Worry I'm not Mike Jordan
 Of the mic recording
 Hovi’ baby you Kobe, maybe Tracy McGrady
Matter fact you Harold Miner, J.R. Rider
 Washed up on marijuana
 Even worse you a Purvis Ellis
 You worthless fella
 You ain't no athlete you Shawn Bradley
 I ain’t talkin' to nobody in particular
 My flow just vehicular homicide when I’m kitchen em
 Yes, anybody in my path
 Is a car crash waiting to happen
 Nigga what?
 I got my foot on the door
 On the post of this rap game and I ain’t letting up
 Yea who’s the nicest life of lifeless mic devices?
 And I don't write this I just mic this
 I will it to happen
 One take hove I’m real in this rapping
 My new name is just the facts
 While the rest of y'all just adjust the facts
 Put words together, just to match
 I say what I feel y’all adjust to that
 I do the opposite of y’all so I just attract
 The realer audience usually unjustly black
 Know my flow and the shit they go just match
 Like the sound of my voice and a choice just track
 I just tackle the something the flack of the public
 Nothing, I know real niggas happen to love it
 If you don’t like it or look in the mirror
 Most likely you ain’t living so you don’t get it
 You ain’t did it so you can envision it

 The language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya
 She was starving a dude to ya
 Growin up hard in a little apartment allude to ya
 I’m just talkin’ to ya

 All these rappers is cooking crack now
 Took the realness out the game it’s time to put it back in

 While Joey’s in the hood like Madden
 Whoa

 Everybody’s a hustler but the money ain’t coming in

 Hater warm rock with his teeth toes wrapped

 Don’t worry yo I’ll bring the east coast back
 No parties this ain’t a movie but meet Joe Black

And stuntin' like Evil Knievel

The more you talk the more you irkin' us
The more you gonna need memorial services

Devil's Pie save some dessert for us


Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy till somebody dies

Man I gotta get my soul right
'For I'm locked up for my whole life
Evertime it seems it's all right
Somebody want they soul to rise
I'll chase you off of this earth


I got dreams of holdin' a Nine milla to Bobs killa
Askin' him why? as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten holmes I still feel ya

So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who 'caused your Church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast, and reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are

Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since we lunch
We shoulda been together havin' 4 seasons brunch

We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches

Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
Well, somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, armor all'd down

You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6

That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped

Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me

Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me

That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that

Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back

They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's goin' bad, she's gone forever
And more forever
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry

I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

It's fucked up girl",Rap
331,Jay-Z,http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-z/young-forever-lyrics/,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

So we livin' life like a video where the sun is always out
And you never get old and the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood

And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorr'
Just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind

So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells ""cut,"" I'll be fine, I'm forever young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, see ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years
Bye-byes are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive

Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops
Young Slung hung here, Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here

And as the father passed his story down to his son's ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsches
Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous
Hold up, niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous

Hold up, I'll be here forever you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in, did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever young?",Rap

 Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
 The flow of the century, oh it's timeless, HOV!
 Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
 I appreciate that

 [Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was servin' em in the home of the Terrapins, got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustler, I was birthing em
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clap the chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
 But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
 Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
 So poof! -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

 [Hook]
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
 For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
 That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
 That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!

 [Verse 2]
I do this for my culture
 To let them know what a nigga look like when a nigga in a Roadster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
 Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
 I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

 [Hook]

 [Verse 3]
 Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
 Niggas acting like I sold you crack
 Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
 So hopefully you won't have to go through that
 I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
 Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
 So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the 2 things I hate
 Succeed, and this rap game: the 2 things that's great
 H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
 What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy",Rap
333,Jay-Z,http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-z/most-kingz-lyrics/,"Young Hov in the house, it's so necessary
Green Lantern in the house, so necessary
Why ya fronting on me, is that necessary?

You know you've become a star
Because you're the biggest target out there
Right?

When everyone's on the court
They're coming for you
When the opposing player walks into that arena
They're thinking of upstaging you

You're, you're like a trophy to them , they're thinking
""If I'm better than this guy the spotlight turns on me""
So, you know you're a superstar because you're a marked man
And everyone's coming for you

The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
(King)

Uh, inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up, break me down to build me up again
They like, ""Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again""

Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac but he's close
How I'm 'posed to win? They got me fighting ghosts
Most kingz get their heads cut off
With the same sword they knight you

They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael

See Martin, see Malcolm, see Biggy, see Pac
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas, see Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide

Suicide, it's a suicide
When you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you, you ghetto

So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, ""Is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?"", because dawg

Most kingz get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'till you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kingz get their heads cut off

The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be
Er'body wanna be the king

Then shots ring
You laying on your balcony with holes in your dream
Or you Malcolm X'd out, get distracted by screams
Er'body get your hand off my jeans

Er'body look at you strange, say you changed
Like you work that hard to stay the same

Uh, name stays the same, the name changes
So it's best for those to not overdose on being famous
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did

So dangerous , no strangers
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Low chain 'em as the enemies approach
So raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat

And the spirit I'm evoking
There's kings who've been awoken
From shots from those
Who was most close to them

They won't stop until you ghost to 'em
But real kings don't die
They become martyrs, let's toast to 'em
King Arthur, put a robe to him

Like James Brown know the show aint over
Until rows roll in

To the republic it's over, though
To my loyal subjects it's over, hoe
Long live the king, no, the rain won't stop
They want my head on the chopping block
I won't die, nah

Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on coming if they're ready or not

Long live the king
No, the rain won't stop

Long live the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
Long live the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king

Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they're ready or not",Rap

It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock

Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Uh huh

Where all my brothers with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot

Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty, uh huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh huh
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my homie biggie, baby

You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Y'all volume 2, sing

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us

Steada kisses, we get kicked

Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour, yeah

I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me cabron plus marricon
Said she likes to cook rice, so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento"", mami slow up your tempo

I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, ""Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better  R E S P E C T me""

I got this French chick that love to french kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
Ma cherie amore, tu es belle
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin' me hell

I got this Indian squaw the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough

Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin' fat
Arroz con pollo, french fries and crepe
An appetitite for destruction but I scrape the plate

Sittin' on deuce-zeroes, fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll, c'mon

I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reebok's no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Gotta toss a couple dollars, just to shut up her holla

Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARC's, hid my guns by the parts

I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time

I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club

Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early plus I know Tae-bo
That means I'm new school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

I love, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya

Sittin' on deuce-zeroes, fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that get shit through

Got this weedhead chick, she always catch me doin' shit
Crazy girl wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick'
'Cause she kept bootleggin' my shit, man

I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me Ms. Fufu but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked and now you want half""

I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleepin' on Hov'
Gotta tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow

Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya

 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
 Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you

 I probably owe it to you all, proud to be locked by the force
 Trying to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
 Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced
 Middle finger to the law, nigga griping my balls
 All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screaming
 All the ballers is bouncing they like the way I be leaning
 All the rappers be hating, off the track that I'm making
 But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
 Came from the bottom the bottom, to the ""Top of the Pops""

 Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
 Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
 In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chilling

 No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

 From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammies
 The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie

We doin', big pimpin', we spendin' G's
Check 'em out now, big pimpin', on B L A D's
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C and B U N B

Yo yo yo, big pimpin', spendin' G's
We doin', big pimpin', on B L A D's
We doin'. big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C and B U N B

Nigga it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe
Then sit back and peep my scenario

Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck a scary hoe
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say, there he go

Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab

Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' slab
Livin' ghetto fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I

Then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt naked, just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on

Pump it up in the prozone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the Glock start poppin' like ozone

We keep hoes crunk like Trigger man
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool

We be big pimpin', spendin' G's
We be big pimpin', on B L A D's
We be big pimpin' down in P A T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C and B U N B

'Cause we be big pimpin', spendin' G's
And we be big pimpin', on B L A D's
'Cause we be big pimpin' in P A T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C and B U N B nigga

Uh, smokin' out, throwin' up, keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all

If I wasn't rappin' baby, I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chromin' shinin' sippin' daily, no rest until whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all know bout them Texas boys
Comin' down in candied toys, smokin' weed and talkin' noise

We be big pimpin', spendin' G's
We be big pimpin', on B L A D's
We be big pimpin' down in P A T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C and B U N B

'Cause we be big pimpin', spendin' G's
And we be big pimpin', on B L A D's
'Cause we be big pimpin' in P A T

341,Jay-Z,http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-z/public-service-announcement-lyrics/,"This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella records
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
That I present this recording, as a living testament and recollection
Of history in the makin' durin' our generation

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov', oh, H to the O V
I used to move snowflakes by the O Z
I guess even back then you can call me
C.E.O. of the ROC, Hov'
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain

That's right Hov', oh, not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No one can do it better""
I check Cheddar like a food inspector
My homey strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie dog

Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out
Did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone
And I don't care what you think about me, but just remember
When it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years
Twenty years from now, you're gonna be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get mine, by any means on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, tryin' to get some change

And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lyin' as if, I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buyin' expensive chains
Hope you don't think, you'se as hardy
Only a fews-us niggaz, gettin' high within' the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins

I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just as hot player
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone",Rap

 First of all I wan' thank my connect

 The first pusher whoever made the stash
 The Roc Boys in the building tonight
 Oh what a feeling I'm feeling life
 Thanks to the lames, niggas bad aim
 Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game
 Bullet wounds will stop your bafoonery
 Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy
 To Lil Kim and them, you know the women friend
 Who, carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
 Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
 And most importantly you, the customer

 You don't even gotta bring ya purses out

 (We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)

 Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
 Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
 Take what the Forbes figure, then figure more
 Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
 Pick a time, lets pick apart some stores
 Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
 I figure frauds never hit a lick before
 So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
 Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
 Feel the Porsche, hit the frost
 Ice cold, jewels got no flaws
 Drop got no top, you on the top floor
 Pink Rosay, think OJ
 I get away with murder when I sling yay
 Niggas got less steps then Britney
 That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

 Red Porsches, rare portraits
 Red glocks if you dare come near the fortress
 This apple sauce is from the apple orchid
 This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
 Which means I get it from the ground
 Which means you get it when I'm around
 Rich niggas, black bar mitzvahs
 Mazel tav, it's a celebration bitches, la heim
 I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time
 Cheers, toast to crime
 Number one b-boy, chain nigga rhyme

[Chorus x3]

 Sweet, let that ride out!
 Bring the horns back in, yeah
 This is black super hero music right here baby

 So for one last time I need y'all to roar

 After me, there shall be no more
 So for one last time, nigga make some noise

 Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
 The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
 Can't none of y'all mirror me back
 Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
 I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
 Back to take over the globe, now break bread
 I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
 Out the country but the blueberry still connect
 On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
 But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
 Grand openin, grand closin
 God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again
 Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
 just draw off inspiration
 Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
 with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

[Verse Two]
[sighs] Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
 Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
 When you first come in the game, they try to play you
 Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
 From Marcy to Madison Square
 To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
 As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
 to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
 When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
 It ain't to play games witchu
 It's to aim at you, probably maim you
 If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens
 Cocksucker take one for your team
 And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
 I came, I saw, I conquered
 From record sales, to sold out concerts
 So muh'fucker if you want this encore
 I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
 OWWWW! It's star time
 This man is MADE! He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys
 Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
 Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man
 Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage
 Say Hova, c'mon say it!
 HO-VA! HO-VA! Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
 Are y'all out there? C'mon, louder!
 Yeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout
 They love you Jigga - they love you Jigga!

 I like the way this one feel
 It's so muh'fuckin soulful man!
 (Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
 Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

 So this here is the victory lap
 Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back
 After a year of them 16's, it's one point two
 And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two
 You wanted to gain attention new dudes
 I can get you BET and TRL too
 You wanna be in the public, send your budget
 Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!
 Young did it to death, you gotta love it
 Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
 Now look at me, all star-studded
 Golfer above par like I putted
 All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous
 How sick is this?
 You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust
 Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit

Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch leathers
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggaz just rhyme

By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat

Fuck 'em, we hate a nigga lovin' this life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the Uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up

I saw his life slippin', this is a minor set back
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get back
That made him smile though his eyes said, ""Pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully

Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention three shots
Close range, never touched me, divine intervention

Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ta Ta
Down in Nevada, ha ha, Poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Potnah, I'm still spendin' money from eighty-eight, what?

You and your wack mans fold like bad hands, roll like Monopoly
Advance you copy me like white crystals, I gross the most
At the end of the fiscal year than these niggaz can wish to

The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the presidental, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime fleas my mind
All sneak thieves and playa haters can shine

But until then, I keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story, the rest you fill it in
Long as the villian win, I spend Japan Yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'

J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life man, pounds and pence
Nuff dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swinging for the fence, Dead Presidents, ya know

Like confetti, mines a steady grow, bet he glow
Pay five dead it from blow, better believe I have
Eleven sixty to show, my doe flip like Tae-Kwon

To change your life huh, roll with the winners

We invite you to somethin' epic y'all know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation we come addicted

Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So we offer you, well we offer our lives right
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet

I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin' 'caine
'Til brains was fried to a francaise, can't lie

At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Gettin' my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughin' hard
Happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief

I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William

Illin' for revenues, grateful dim the light
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand gettin' the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure

Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it

Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you tryin' to get into?

Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas

G-g-geah, can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity

You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole care, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, explode

On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish

Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with Ludicrous, dreams of
Gettin' cream let's do this, against TDS
So I keep one eye open like, CBS, ya see me

I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex And The City'

She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over

With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'

The only time you wear Burberry to swim

If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah

Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so, I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust, if you was my boyfriend

Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

A wise man told me don't argue with fools
'Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's, not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks

I will end it, all that yappin' be finished

Don't make me expose to them folks that don't know you

And all you other cats throwin' shots at Jigga
You only get half a bar, fuck y'all niggaz",Rap

They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul de sac and plenty congnac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?] watchin Lucky ride down Rosecrantz
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand, where --- hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Packed to stand on every porch was fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
Or warn the bullets comin from
AK's,AR's,""aye y'all. Duck.""
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trollie
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Teck
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dahsed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I really don't smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life

Block a nigga in
Alandra, Rosecrants, Bullice
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the corners like hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the power then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects

Hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant you bitch

Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond ""Let it Burn"" came on
Hot sauce in my Top Ramen, ya bitch
Parked the car and then we started rhyming, ya bitch
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up you bitch
A silver spoon I know you come from you bitch
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel

Back to reality we pour
Another casualty of war
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'

Cause I ain't leavin' alone, I feel like I could be honest, babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I'm hopin' you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time (waste my time)

Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics

State your name, live in the moment
It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away

And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it

Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright, yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright, oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste my time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, baby
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa

How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect to sip juice
From the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done

You put two and two together Cole here forever

Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time

So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All in my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-

I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double XL
Or fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the boyz I'm the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect

Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood

Go, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind

You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can't tell your energy is dangerous
I don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand

I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock

Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal

Sleepwalking on another big stage 
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream 
Your name and your song, I'm so far away 
From the place I used to be, struggling usually 
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me 
I can feel the energy in the air 
It feel like I'm supposed to here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love 
Fans, the stars, everyone 
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP 
And I'm gonna blow

Feel so good in what you do 
Helps somebody else get through 
That's why I do the best I can 
Because I know how blessed I am

And it's now or never 
I shine so bright I light the night 
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

A fool if I take it all for granted 
A smart man if I keep my feet planted 
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it 
You speakin' outlandish 
I'mma show you how to make it all work 
Another plan, it a short term goal for me 
A reconcile for me 
It's just more of and me and you're here 
For you to hear Kendrick persevere 
Defenses I feel relentless 
And visual with a clear vision 
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons 
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance 
Came across me, how much it'a cost me 
To get you out my business 
I set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit 
I'm past that, now pass that 
Award, not one but four 
Times two plus yours

I see myself performing there (K.dot) 
Sold out shows where the room is packed 
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards 
See myself on big billboards

Can't imagine how it feels 
That's why I'm smiling everyday 
Because my dream ain't far away

You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed 
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath 
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly 
You see me when at my best, my worst 
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept 
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed 
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown 
I'm a King on the prowl and I (seem I'm a smile)? 
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break 
You can break bread with me now 
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal 
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue 
And walked that mile 
In the darkness I often sit back 
And get lost in the rap that I wrote 
When you told me that it spoke to your soul 
I was talking to you 
I was walking it through every ghetto 
Tell success hello 
We here 

[Hook: Mary J. Blige] 
And I'm so happy I cry 
Cause I can't believe 
All the things I ever wanted 
Are finally happening for me 
And it's so surreal 
That I almost feel 
Any minute I can wake up 
From this fantasy 
When you pray so hard 
And you've come so far 
And you know that it's the time for you lift your? 
And I'm gunna do it 
Watch me

 Why you tell me that you love me
 Why you always thinking of me when my company rather than going club hopping
 Why you treatin' my momma like she your momma too
 Why you making promises that you'll forever do
 Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
 These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you

 Sometimes
 We hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us

 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair
 But where do we seem to fall
 Where do we seem to fall
 Tender love and care, once upon a time
 Once upon a time, we was there

 And so she said
 Why you gotta be so mean to me
 Why you don't know what you mean to me
 Why you always playing games
 Why I feel like you ashamed
 Out in public curse me out and make a scenery
 Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
 My text messages poppin up saying ""Hi Daddy""
 Why you treat me like I'm nothing
 Why you always outta function
 I be wanting to go out but you don't ever ask me
 Why you slip and say her name when we having sex
 Why you always assuming that I still love my ex
 Every time we get into it I'm the one that's feeling stupid
 You don't need me, you gon' leave me
 That's ya favorite threat
 Why you never know how it feel to be lonely
 Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies
 Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
 Even though you get violent and put your hands on me

 Sometimes
 We hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us
 Hurt people that love us
 Love people that hurt us

 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair
 But where do we seem to fall
 Where do we seem to fall
 Tender love and care, once upon a time
 Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: ""She Says She Loves Me"" by Lamont Carey]
 She says she loves me. She says she loves me, so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone. But she's beautiful, like sometimes I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen. And she only gives advice. She says she loves me, like when I wake up in the morning, shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me. She says she needs me, she says she loves me. Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off. She says, she says she loves me. So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake, she says she loves me... and I don't know about love.",Rap

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going? We should be slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what she said to me, the place I used to call home is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they stare me with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
Tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what it said to me but the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten
Alcoholic tripping, fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls, balling out but I’m about to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what he said to but that place we call Heaven is unfair to me
Only 144 can go, seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know?
I know to follow him rather than follow people or follow vanity
‘Cause that means I’m following evil, guess I’m following evil
I should follow cathedral, blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion, we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified, we all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It’s just a part of life
And if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Trying to visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground but we’re always in a hurry
And if I could make this world stand a little slower then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer…",Rap

This courtesy of Compton
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water inside, you're Bobby Boucher
We thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga

Pipe down, on the curb when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent

And lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals
Leaving a body sore
She take the little change she make
To fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable
To make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur
THat's her favorite rapper
Bumping ""Brenda's Got A Baby""
While a pervert yelling at her
And he capture features of a woman
But only 17
The 7 car start humming
She start running like FLoJo
Don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow
A blow job is a sure go
And she know enough
She see a dime of dirty dollars
She give it up to her daddy
But she don't know her father
That's how rotten
Live a block away from ? park
I seen the El Camino parking
In her heart she hate it there
But in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters
So she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor
When she making ends' meet

Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple
Her castle is about to be destroyed
She's always paranoid
Watching the law on the streets
Undercover dummies that look
Like decoys. Remember the sergeant
Let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs
He'd compromise. To no surprise
She took the ultimatum
Around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him
Right below the navel. Though
He was wired up like
A pair of jumping cables, his
Eyes was closed shut
Prior charges, he had waved em
A block away from ? park
I seen a squad car
Parked, in her heart, she made it there
But in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she
Hit the back seat. Rosa Parks
Never a factor when she topping off police

She'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man
Needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now
She's numb to it. Sometimes she
Wonder if she can do it like
Nuns do it. But she never heard
Of Catholic religion or sinners' redemtion
That sounds foolish, and you
Can blame her mother, for letting
Her boyfriends take her undercover
10 months before she was moved in
That's when he touched her
Here's the fucking reason why
Keisha rushing through that block
Away from ? park
I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there
But in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters
So she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside her bladder
Left her dead in the street

Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down *a green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean

Cause Plan A only can make another mistake 
And you can't see success coming from plan C

Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch

In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out

Back stroke every day in Chicago

Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular

Looking to make a vow soon

Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:

I miss you, where you been?
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you

[Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
different girls, different towns
To keep it real, you missing out
I'll all bored, next city
Random cars, TEC's with me
Like I miss you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that, I don't care Dom
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom
Meet me here, where Dom?
Get undressed, yeah Dom
Yeah Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?
Good food? Japanese?
That's me on page forty in that magazine
""Dom Kennedy"" you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back
and she need me, believe that

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles
Truant like a student, you the principal
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness, you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers posters
By my waistline, shout for your hard hit
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[Chorus]

[MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying cuz
She need me, I got that John Bryan love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say yes, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

No makeup today (today) (x4)

I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on
It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Macbook
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettyness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections
Is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
I love your smile
You can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her
But when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

Look
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause you see that no one wants you back and it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be, and that’s you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain’t snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me

[Verse 1:]
Eems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have*
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait,
Is fate procrastinating?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's

[Chorus: x2]
The girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lying to myself?
Ay, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2:]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her all the way home without her knowing
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave to me,
Imagine what she'll say to me: this ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy, it's

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Look, I spot her walking in the mall,
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my god, I'm walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,
""Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch, some R&B and rap, ay you should come thru""
She said, ""uh, I love too, except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that""
Okay, you say you got a man, I mean, I definitely understand,
I'm happy for you, really am, I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world Of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme to get

[Verse 4:]
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?
I'm a follow in my car; I'm a cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you,
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them go deep like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance,
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip don't fall,
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance,
Don't lose your balance

I look around at my city this is SinVille
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why the cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it I just had another friend killed
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it ""When will, this shit change? ""
It said boy ""Just use them pen skills""-
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you cause you my brother so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but there's bigger better things
And for those that passed I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

Yea and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance,
Don't be losing your balance,
My nigga don't be losing your balance,
Uh yea so don't slip, don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance, uh
Don't lose your balance

I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal I'm a... sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men ah sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' I did the same when I saw that ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slime face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensai
Now she got me chillenin' with her all around the clock
My homeis beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick will make me switch
But man I can't help it dog her mind got me whipped

I think I'm losing my balance
I think I'm losing my balance yea
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance,
But I won't slip I won't fall,
Just a get a grip and hold on
Losing my balance,

Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
 Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
 Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
 No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
 Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
 Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
 Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
 Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
 Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you

 If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
 Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
 Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
 I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
 Just fuck her one time and be through it forever

Yea, keep following me keep calling me*
Yea, yea, yea
Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky!
Science can tell us how how but they can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed, the beauty of life-
The pain never lasts
The rain always past, the sun don't always shine
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, 100 yrs ago I would of called Id a call this nigga masta
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
I'm looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You cay I'm easily distracted I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm trynna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
Omen
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail, maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart?
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard-
Nights with no progress
Man I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Locness in the projects before I find this-
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Couture strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me",Rap

Appear, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city with nigga will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibally stretch in a mess he's smoking a blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that
All I do is pray for that

And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas and desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how

Ay, I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hatin' but I love them even though they trynna scheme
But I'm past that, a niggas stock is raising like the Nastec
They same I'm the future but yet I'm giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days, when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga I say what they never say
Whenever they, spit that bullshit they spittin, this that pool pit I'm hittin niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dolla in my pocket, plus a dream
Yea you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I'll tell you what them scares like
I'm speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mails I feel like Cartwright, bills
Forreal, a nigga I'll
Just let me do the talking men I know how niggas feel

Every nigga ain't no dog, and every nigga ain't no king

Every nigga can't dunk, so white man can jump
They shooting niggas fo' they even tell em put their hands up!
Crooked cops, got a nigga scared to drive probably thinking that I'm slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dolla plus a dream
Yea you swear your girl is faithful everything ain't what it seems
See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst
I bet if I was to hit men, I wouldn't be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get from the Bible, for your survival

You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you,
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time, a nigga graduated

Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin',
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend?
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful?
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, poured out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crypt or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga
Yeah

Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
Aye, aye
Aye baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did this for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
Uh, this is a song for the Ville

Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville
I ain't seen six figures but I feel like a mill'
Cause I'm fresh up off the deal, will I chill? Never that!
I'm the hottest nigga out and you could tell the devil that
Got that crack! Went from pebble to that Roc, pedal that
So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the trouble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now they bustas couldn't catch up even if I pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! I'll be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot call kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, ""Jay said all that? ""
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop peers know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no test could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again

Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had to dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga

From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tot gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, while he repo that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gats
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, ""Please, roll strapped""
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that

If hope floats I took the boat up to the city of Queens
But phony niggas showed me quick this ain't the sillier scenes
Hey! Fish out of water from the city of the dreamers
When young niggas feemin for them big body beamers
They told us we can have the world if I can get a deal
Maybe I could show the Ville that it's real

I put this on everything, I love
This is, my sweat and uhh my blood
(Who's world is this) You know it's mine
Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind
(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball
And uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall

(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine)

Hey, straight out the Ville and I made it, hope you feeling my latest
Ayy what I spit on these pages highly anticipated, contagious
So when I spit it you gonna get it
Slightly different from these rappers who just spit but don't let it see
I ain't no flashy nigga so don't expect me to floss
These niggas out here rappin with their fucking fingers crossed
I was a dreamer then I came up with a plan
Where I land I put it all on gods hands

I put this on everything, I love

Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit
Like she was featured on that piece of shit, man
Keep on squeaking like some sneakers on the court
Here's some lines you can snort
Food for thought here's a fork
No pork, dammit keep it pure, organic
What's the score, Lord it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin but see me I'm just gonna show out
Bitches destiny no doubt
Niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored this shit is simple
On instrumentals I'm Kimbo, slicing on any tempo
I'm busting like many pimples on the temple,
Ho hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to HOV but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
I almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep em

Leave you leakin' 'til a plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your packs mama we gettin the fuck up outta Poland
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough

I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should of known nothing last forever(X2)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be, out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough to finally
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

Like that's all I know
And lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I'm getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1:]
Yeah school girl, cool girl
Your dress is sexy and your momma is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folk's thing
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool girl
You got your new hair, it looks so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him round school and he won't look
Now girl you wiz fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it
That's cause your mind don't match with your ass got
But cheer up you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're looking for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter you could be somebody
A doctor, a rockstar baby live life
But you'd rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking

Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I'm high I feel the lows

Is life worth living should I blast myself
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the glock to my head feel I'd rather be dead
And am I hopeless, raised with rats and roaches
Never liked the teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ass must have mattered but you can't relate
Living a life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I'm stuck here
That's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother yeah I love her but things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars it was hard to see her suffer
Ducking my heart and I don't know if I'll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She say she proud of me and I wonder what for
And once more

Even through the joy I feel the pain

And ever since we hit the depression niggas don know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya'll feel the glare I got to go now
I riding through the city with the windows roll down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her

Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzan
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change

Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!

I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me what's work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world,
It's just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler",Rap

Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer ""get the appeal""
With the flick of the pen write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Bridge]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend ""Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke""
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Bridge & Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rose, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, Im talkin serious Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life & Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged I'll just play my part

Miscellaneous
If I Ruled The World""(feat. Lauryn Hill
[Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)]

Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know

[Verse One: Nas]

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]

If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

[Verse Two: Nas]

The way to be, paradise like relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonner set free, stress free 
No work release purple M3's and jet skis 
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]

If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse Three: Nas]

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck??

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]

If I ruled the world 
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled 
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds 
Could it be, if you could
black diamonds 
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons
black diamonds, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I love em love em baby!!",Rap

What's up niggas, ay yo
I know you ain't talkin' 'bout me dog
You, what? Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick nigga
You love my style, nigga
Fuck Jay-Z""

(I)
Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will)
Teach you the king you know you
(Not)
""God's son"", across the belly
(Lose)
I prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big

Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage

Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne
I got this, locked since '9-1
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian' Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

(I)
Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will)
Teach you the king you know you
(Not)
""God's son"", across the belly
(Lose)
I prove you lost already

Ay yo, pass me the weed
Pour my ashes out on these niggas man
(No doubt)
Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the fuckin' ring

(I)
Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will)
Teach you the king you know you
(Not)
""God's son"", across the belly
(Lose)
I prove you lost already

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face

Y'all some ""Well wishers"", friendly actin', envy hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef

Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint

First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve
To say that you better than Big
Dick suckin' lips, won't you let the late, great veteran live
(I will not lose)
""God's son"" across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
  (Ill Will)
Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas

(I)
Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will)
Teach you the king you know you
(Not)
""God's son"", across the belly
(Lose)
I prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous

And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is hard, hug me, don't reject me

Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your buildin'
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with

Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase

You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge

Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy

Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?

Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks?

Negro please, you no mustache havin', with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Caine, to Herb, to Big

And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R O C get gunned up and clapped quick

J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shaun Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick

How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss",Rap
400,Nas,http://www.songlyrics.com/nas/hate-me-now-lyrics/,"Escobar Ceaser has returned

It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me, let's go

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
Do it now, do it now, do it now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches honeys that swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ring side try watchin' my paper

Almost a decade quite impressive, most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for expanding more to the big screen
Bill Gates dreams but it seems you'd rather see me
In jail with state dreams
Want me off the scene fast but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Do it now

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
Do it now, I told you do it now, let's go

You wanna hate me then hate me, what can I do?
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up until I made it
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga, nothing to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol' G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us

My bad, should I step out my shoes give 'em to you?
Here's my car and my house you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that 'cause niggas feel this right

You think I'm gonna come this far
And let you niggas stop me now? I hate you too
Do it now

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
I like this, I like the way this feels, let's go

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates, I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, He blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop

And I side with the Lord, ride for the cause
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
Plottin, I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaw
Try stickin' my up but I but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess its just a theory of man became a monster, atop of the world
Never fallin', I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
And that's what you can't understand

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
C'mon niggas, you can hate me now but I won't stop now

It ain't gon never stop, niggas",Rap

It ain't you it's the things you do
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you, to hell with you

If heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside
When it opens would you try to die today?

Would you pray louder
Finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see
But you could feel, would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?

Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell
That you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high
Would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in

To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this racist planet
Where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car
Put your motherfucking hands up

Thinking I'm a lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold

I'ma stop building, I'ma stop feeling
Like I'm Amistad's great, great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions

Since the quarter water days
In the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper
In my mouth all day

But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back
Cristal blowing dub sacks

That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less
My nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly

Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks
Free of any autographs so not to be recognized
Forgive me, it's becoming unbearable, making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook
There you go with a platinum CD

I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing
God is watching before the Lord

How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought
Wishing that I fled the earth

If heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags
And leave this world behind?
If heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?

Every day I wakeup I'm blessed
Every day you wakeup
And breathe another breath you blessed

It's all the niggaz runnin' around, talk about I'm fucked up
I gotta get on, I gotta, I'm in a grind
I'm fucked up, yeah we're all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life

All my niggaz locked up, keep yo heads up
Heaven's just a mile away, I'm talkin' heaven on earth
Ain't got nottin' to do with money
Got nottin' to do with non-material

I'm talkin' about heaven in your own heart
In your own world baby, in your own existence
To my moms look at me baby
I love you girl, your boy is shinin', God's son",Rap

I'll beat that pussy up there's no denyin'
Hit her where she doodie at, make that booty fat
Little cutie rat, walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, air max
Small Gucci bag
No loot and no job
Stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
you got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them tities hang, I'll have all the bitches sayin'

oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally

He really really really fucked my coochie
He really really really turned me out
He really really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout

When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Aint no sleepin' in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way i thug and the way i flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Lomg in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang

Thugz Mansion (Nas Acoustic)""(feat. 2Pac, J. Phoenix
[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey
The best journey
Acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verson One: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like does over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug block missionaries
Pass out papers that read: Love God
See faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one in particular 
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad
Blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helpin' hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little busy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright 
Nothin but peace, love 
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne
What angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion

Stay
Stay (oh, oh)
Stay (oh, oh)


[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a knight from England, that's what I named my son: Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickin's, but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'mma just...
Stay

[Refrain]
Stay
Stay (oh, oh)
Stay (oh, oh)

Verse 2:
Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hatin' is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...

What I'm gonna do?
Uh, Lord, Lord Jah
Shit is all true

Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki
Got wings but you can't fly away from me

Drivin' in your bucket seats all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you've done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for 'bout a half an hour

You in your hot tub, I'm lookin' at you salivatin'
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waitin'
Lay you down â€~cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot

Then I flock to the bed then plop
When we done I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast

Misses Fried Chicken
You gon' be a nigga's death
Created by southern black women
To serve massa, guest

You gon' be a nigga's death
Misses Fried Chicken
You was my addiction
Drippin' wet hot, coalesced

Like Greeks with their Souvla
Or Italians with their tomato pasta
Or Roti is to a Rasta, trappin' me
You and your friend mac and cheese

[Incomprehensible] collard greens
But you knockin' me to my knees
It's killin' me when I miss, ah
Nothin' I need more than a fish fry

Shit, it taste good, I can't lie, it's like you're walkin' out a tannin' saloon
When I pull you out the oven from bakin' I got you on my mind
Rubbin' that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazin', how you sparkle when I glaze, you swine

Hey, my pretty hand hot, it's so feminine the way you submittin'
And how you gave me power, to massagin' me to shower
You with lemon water, marinate you and season
And dippin' you in chowder

Baby, it's like you at the spa, the way you gently lay in the pan
While you enjoyin' you butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubblin' on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance still I lick my finger frequent

In any event I'm reflectin' on all the signs that I got
Sayin' that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you taste made it hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue

Butterflies up in my stomach when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifestin'?
Confused over the feelin' impatiently eatin' you
[Incomprehensible] worm chewin' on the wall of my intestine

I'ma eat you til there's nothin' left, until my very last breath
You gon' be a nigga death, despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cookin' swine as a chef
You gon' be a nigga death

Who cares if the swine is mixed with rats, cats and dogs combined
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death, ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eatin' kills me
And I choose to do that, why? 'Cause that's just what niggas do",Rap
407,Nas,http://www.songlyrics.com/nas/you-re-da-man-lyrics/,"Uh uh, yo

They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name

Nas too real, Nas true king
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists only kill squads

Fame went to they head, so now it's fuck Nas
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it comin' soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do

Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changin' on the world since barbecue
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said

If I, ever make a record I take a check and put something away
For a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since in the project, crack in my socks weep

I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'
I saw a dead bird flyin' through a broken sky

Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings and Ghana stay
So I could get on my flesh right away
But that'll be the day when it's peace

When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimmin' in eternal fire

Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin' me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly

I'm the N the A to the S I R
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
Forty-five in my waist, starin' at my reflection
In the mirror, sittin' still in the chair like my conception

When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It's clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to and God, I'm so thankful

You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man
You're da man, you're da man",Rap

At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

[Hook: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you
It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

So you can't blame jazz musicians

Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B

On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not takin' it lightly

Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed

Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta

Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

And they came to show love

Wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your eight bed room mansion

Up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond
Galileo's understanding
Past the Milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater
But only God knows, scientist claim we came from apes
But they lies though, that was part of our conversation

I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinking of how amazing she was
A Angel gave me love
I'm thankful, to ever know a women so real
I pray when I marry my wife I have one of your skills
But mom you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day to have

One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama
Praying, wishin' I could have
One more dance with you mama

I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
If only I can hear your voice and your laughter

Just one more time
My chest would be filled up with sunshine April seven four two
That's when the gates of Heaven opened up for you
To stroll through beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived threw you sons and your grandchildren

Jesus finally got his bride, mommy dance with him
And you've been my guide threw all the trouble I faced
They playing our song the life beat my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand and try not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed
Dreaming I could have

One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama

Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Puff Daddy]
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch (do it now)

[Base Chorus]

[2nd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't stop
I can't stop
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Nas] Do it now, I told you do it now
[Puff] Let's go

[Verse 2]
You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

[Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!!  (Do it now!)

[Base Chorus]

[3rd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't stop
I can't stop
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] I like this.. I like the way this feels

[Verse 3]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors
Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin
C'mon

[Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Base Chorus]

[4th Chorus: start w/ Puff Daddy, then after each pause]
You can hate me now
I won't stop
I can't stop
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] You can hate me now
[Nas] C'mon niggas
[Puff] But I won't stop now
[Nas] Do it now! Get this shit over with
[Puff] But I won't stop now..

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

Yo, I never brag, how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watchin' Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons

A tec' squeezin', executioner, winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular, center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson

City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tachinni flippin' mad pies
Low price, I blow dice and throw 'em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the, ""Do or Die"" slogan

My niggaz roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll
Blankin' out and never miscount the shells my gun hold

I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I seperate, watchin' crab niggaz marinate
I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin' out, every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's

Currency is made in trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind, and Fire singing reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early

Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo

You must be buggin' out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy

I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye

Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high

Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facing twenty years in the basement
Chilling on the via with Mumia for wearin' chrome, I told the judge
Snakes slither like Sharon Stone, but like Capone I'm thrown

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's

Yo the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation

We livin' in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin' boy

Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggaz wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani

It's just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow

Rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses

Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggaz transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings

Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggaz with the tecs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

[Verse 1: Nas]
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she

I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I’m rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know, or am I a fool or ass
I’m well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo and Stitch

Lies and the pain
Betrayal; life

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Snitches and rapists in the street
Crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that
They know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
Letter T
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe
Then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand
What’s the options
Only conclusion is shooting
Bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous
Asking myself what’s my purpose
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me
Death to prison, empty vacancy

[Refrain]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 2: Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed
Strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into bestiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
To mainline dope, and ya'll know

[Refrain]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3: Nas]
So many vices, habits
Mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars
Cigars in Venice, bottle on ice, that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent
Same time, premedidating murdering his ex wife
Life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

For niggaz don't know how to act, what the deal son
I shot the motherfucker back, no doubt son
For niggaz don't know how to act

Yo NYC, U N I verse, seriously
Havoc and P, Queens niggaz so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise, mega
Got word back from Noreaga

The D.A. got video cassette taper
The God with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles

I been through, crime shit my niggaz into
Peep the issue situation like this, we stickin' him too
JFK on our way to L.A.
Got links with big cats down to Santa Barbara

My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay? Drill me
Niggaz kill me, thrillin' me, you wanna look?
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drilly

Niggaz suspect, weak links pose threats, I have yet
To met challenger who go against my set
Gem stars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me

I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burglars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about 5,000 a plate

No doubt kid, I hit them niggaz like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me and the gat that's holdin' me

We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped
Floatin' in the river with your body wrapped in plastic

Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Could tear men, cut the party short while you jammin'

We think smarter, reach harder, got the 44
Bodyguard of somethin' and you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

Niggaz thinkin' shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queen's murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait

I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world
Where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist

Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggaz mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerrilla ice on this killer's life

I put my word on it, now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam' but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catchin' charges of marksmen, livin' heartless

Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggaz in mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throgs Neck
Heads bop, I see 'em

For niggaz don't know how to act
To all my niggaz on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggaz layin' on they back
To all the niggaz who bust gats, live nigga rap

For niggaz don't know how to act

To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin' it was then
Instead a, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw

Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I wrap it like a envelope package

And they would send the dope back then
Numbers, pimpin' and robbin', well, they still robbin' and pimpin'
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin'
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin'

Trips expensive gift shoppin' whip drivin'
Benz's, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin' you thinkin' naw it's just rhymin'
But all this time it's like organized crimin'

For instance there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin', everybody got paper
Words of power because of it the cops hate ya

The government watchin' all of those who thuggin' it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin' it
Not knowin' that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars

We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars

Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy B battles when it was peace

Caught myself driftin' in thought 'cause now it's different I thought
Niggaz was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shannon Scott, LaRock in the jams

Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin' mother had a motherfucker

I don't think about it niggaz talkin' there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a plant yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris

Y'all niggaz roll with any click that's winnin' any crew
Doin' whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars

'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

This ain't no Oscars or MTV, or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold we livid

Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a the mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin' on your nine to five jobs

Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin' east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube

Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that

'Cause they'll be in your enemies face sayin', it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin' the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in Kay Bee Toys store

Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you

I could cry, I could smile, I might lay back for awhile
Tell me what, what would I do if I could feel you?

He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buyin'

Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy, just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was

I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin' wow, she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in the movie

Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it he shoot me

You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go

What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?

I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us

Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit, a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of hip-hop comin' through a white rapper

My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now buggin' 'cause the label had just dropped Def Jam

Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees

Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion?
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then

What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?
What, what, what would I do?

Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive

Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

What, what, what would I do?

You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
Trustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror
Lookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya
We smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh
Light it up light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble
Reactin before thinkin, they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin
When we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin
Instead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shoutin, police pushin the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him
Am I hallucinatin off the hazin?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
(?) Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you
So, my state of mind's all purple",Rap

The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holdin' out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable eighty-six shit, foreign cars young with crazy bitches

Man smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin', ill editions of that Murder I wrote
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand

And in the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S classes, chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch

Clutchin' gats quick to bust
But knowin' how these niggaz tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

Nas is coming, Nas is coming
Nas is coming
(Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

Nas is coming, Nas is coming
Nas is coming
(Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam

Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasin'
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, Blazin' hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro

Compared to these niggaz who swear to be the real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin' bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.

A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin' venereal
But back in stereo

Nas is coming, Nas is coming
Nas is coming
(Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

Nas is coming, Nas is coming
Nas is coming
(Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game, you got it twisted

Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist', push the six with the biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all
Fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in

My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet,Cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero

Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin' low
Profile, white gold style, rakin' bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive he strugglin' for the phone
Fo' fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung

Nas is coming, Nas is coming

It's Nasty Nas and Dr. Dre

That's how we makin' it happen

That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo, Nas, let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfuckin' clowns out here

Riffin' and beefin' about this bullshit
Yo, heh

We just gon' kickback with these honies, this Cristal

[Intro: Nature]
You don't know how to fucking rhyme
KnowwhatI'msaying? all ya bitch ass niggas
All ya bitch ass niggas
All ya niggas, knowwhatI'msaying?
all ya bitch ass niggas, ya fake ass niggas
Ayo, ayo, ayo

[Nature]
Y'all know my pedigree, hoes blow the gods voluntarily
We're world wide, my heart pumps where the ghettos be
Young sharks be telling me, y'all niggas can't swim, y'all drowning
From my hood to your hood, the anthem, y'all wilding
I die for my coalition, the foes whispering
Hating, Wild Gremlinz and knows that roll with 'em
So I chose rap, we vamped to neva go back
Until this life of animosity, the high velocity
Niggas be on the same team planning to blow shots at me
Be the same mouths I try to feed
I write shit, entice it properly, 'til it hurts me
The same game as James Worthy, they spread my name like it's Herpes
Nature, niggas on the block boxing me, y'all not complete
We take this shit to where it gots to be, now smile philosophy

[Nas]
Sex and money go together like techs and nine shells
Swiss cheese you and cover it up like Roswell
Cartel, you ain't seen no iller regime
The Celest team, prophecy, project warrior, owns property
Crackers hate it, cops get jealous 'cause I stay with
The '98 temporary plates on my whip
The system thing is not right
A rich thug could fuck a cop's wife
'Cause I'm on television and live the pop life
I rock mics, make mills, sound scan sales
One point whateva records, professional skills
Money's the root of evil but it'll make you happy
Don't wanna shoot my people but still they might clap me
'Cause I talk like Dr. Malakayork, played the sidewalk
Hold fort, diamond plate chain, gold fork
Get in tune, rich life Ricky for silver spoon
Frank Lopez's crib, elevators and living room

[Noreaga]
Ayo we're still in Queens, same place where we use to be
Often you won't see us, 'cause we're usually out touring
Leave the hood now the hood boring
NORE, you know me, we're regulating
Straight from Iraq with QB affiliated
It's like a higher learning
From 99th street down to Vernon
Letting our heat burst burning
Like henny wet, throwing up my set
Catch me on star tec, 'bout to set the connect
Yo sex, drugs, money and murder, beers and sex
Lands and Lex in the projects
The 4th floor where we score through our cook-up
D's shook-up, hit the block and now you look up

[Nature]
Whispers turning to screams, from screams to hollers
Fans turn to fanatics, go home and dream about us
My zone, I need the chronic, my habit daily
Spitting, rapping fury, I got more steps then Alvin Ailey
Thousands will fear me, my nickname Braille
Dietec, the fakest niggas, 'cause their cliques ain't real
Each verse be pain fields, force to taking Motrin's
From the street to the screen, pictures be major motion
Nature grossing, holding my square where snake's approaching
React quickly, keeping gats where my dick be
A buck equal a hundred, so a half is fifty
Y'all do the math with me, before I hurt you
It's personal, you and I know, my whole squad be U-N-I-versal
From blood in to blood out, we thugged out
Fuck a four-four, I go to snub route, leave you rubbed out

[Nas]
Death followed him, before it swallowed him whole
It was signs he should of read that was inside his soul
Niggas light dutchies to 'em now
So long miss a muthafucka but still life goes on
Hope I'm rich on my last day, clutching some ass
Nigga said he came in with, got a nut when he passed
An old man laying dead on my bed, with some young shit
Screaming out ""freedom"" when I slumped her chest
After that, chill, be a bitch with a hex
Every nigga she sexed, be the next put to rest

[Noreaga]
Yo since a young sibling, had every flavor Timberland
Always had a jump shot and always dribbling
John McEnroe, Jose lay like Casserole
Doling Mike Tys', the jungle low, cut the china white
Come check ya, mixed the henny with the nectars
On straight flights while y'all cats connectors
If it was up to me, the whole world would be comfortably
But since its not, y'all niggas stay fucked up
I think about y'all too much and be bankrupted
So niggas get yours, I got mines niggas, so what, what?

[Outro]

[Noreaga] Word, it's like the battle symbolize the war (Indeed)
and the war symbolizes the winners of the battle
youknowwhatImean? (No doubt) go at your neck, go at your neck
[Nas] Either you in it, or you're in the muthafucking way baby
[Noreaga] Word up and annihilate your ass
[Nas] Queensstyle, youknowwhatI'msaying?

Yo go 'head, do that shit nigga

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessey holders and old school niggaz
Then I be dissin' a unofficial that smoke woolie Thai
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer

Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke

It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous nighttimes and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cog-nac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggaz no sheisty vice to just snipe ya

Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With sidebets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
  (Peace God)
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggaz on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, it's like that y'all

Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge

One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggaz deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the Ganja

Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank

Pumpin' for somethin', some uprise, plus some fail
Judges hangin' niggaz, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats

They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck rap is real, watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queens bridge

Comin' outta, comin' outta, comin' outta Queens bridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin' outta, comin' outta, comin' outta Queens bridge
The most dangerous MC is

Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose

If I slip away, if I die today the last thing you remember won't
Be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur,
Baby how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed but the demons I confronted would disperse,
Have you ever heard of some shit so real?
Beyond from the heart, from the soul you can feel..

And if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take

I don't need to worry cause I know the world'll feel this nigga

Wish I was Jigga Man, carefree livin'

I'm the Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn boy

You know how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom

On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
Why he by himself?

He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister got me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense
Since my father died, I ain't been writin' since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split a eighth of 'shrooms just so I could see the universe

I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom

Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done, and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the womb
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon

I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than life, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

It's close to go and tryin' some coke
And a happy ending be slitting my throat
Ignorance the coke man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that shit

If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jackass
Don't give a shit when people talkin' 'bout fam'
Haters shake my hand, but I keep the sanitizer on deck

Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry

Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali trees
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live

I gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
But how to be, I'm whackin' cheese into the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who in all the rappers kids be

And who they love hands to the universe
Pop into the drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad little mama sits her down gets her out her purse
Long as the beauty lookin' juicy and he's stylin' on him

As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass

As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as 1, 2, 3

As our hero seems to be dreamin' in peace
A dark chapter unfolds throwing Scott into
The most eerie and unstable part of his imagination
So intense, he cannot tell his dreams from reality
This is the rise of the night terrors",Rap

[Verse 1: King Chip]
 I'm just what you made God - not many I trust
 I'm a go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
 I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
 Club-hoppin', tryin' to get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
 Early in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
 Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
 Thank the Lord for that burning bush, that big body Benz I was born to push
 On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
 Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
 I say, ""Ain't no music on"" she said, ""Naw, that weed is loud""
 Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
 I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', weed livin'

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
 I need smoke
 I need to smoke
 Who gon' hold me down now
 I wanna get high y'all
 I wanna get high y'all
 Need it need it to get by y'all
 Can you get me high y'all?
 I wanna get high y'all
 I wanna get high y'all
 Need it need it to get by y'all
 Can you get me high y'all?
 I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
 I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
 (Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
 I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
 Let me tell you 'bout my month y'all, endless shopping, I had a ball
 I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don't think that helps at all
 Whatever, that man ain't wearing these leather pants
 I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain't working fam
 In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
 I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you'd understand
 But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
 We're all troubled, in a world of trouble
 It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
 I'm what you made God, fuck yes I'm so odd
 Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
 Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
 Everyday to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

I smoke the best weed
I carefully pick out the stems and seeds (seeds)
The doctors orthers keeps my eyes a bleed
And ever night a different gal a breed (breed)
I never smoke alone
So mr weed man please pick up your phone (phone)
I need some herb to get inna the zone
And my girl kasandra needs a quarter pound (pound)
A just the video light bless up the woman keep them sitting tight (tight)
If you wah come back to my place I'll fuck you right
Anytime you want the ride girl just call me day or night (night)
It's just the medicine little bit of weed mix with the good liquor trigers my adrenaline
Little bit of weed never kill no one mr law so don't be mad at me, me, me
Legel or not that shit don't matter me, me, me

[Verse 2: ~Pitbull~]
Day and night
I find myself thanking god for my left
Because I took all the wrong and made it right
And I picked rapping over dealing white, white, white
I took my fathers hustle, And I took all of my families struggle
Mixed it up with all my mothers pain, But wot you see is wot gives pitbull's a name, name, name

[Bridge: ~Pitbull~]
Because day and night
I find myself alone in this fame
They know my music but not my mind
They can try but they won't stop my hustle grind, grind, grind [Repeat:]

[Verse 3: ~Kid Cudi~]
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind,
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play
Now look at this
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last last

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Because day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

[Verse 4: Jim Jones]
We born to die
So I get high just like I'm born to fly
I'm in the court wif marijuana eyes
We hit the clubs until the morning rise
Cause day and night
We run the streets
Hope I dnt pay dat prise
Dey qot d nerve to tell me press my brakes
And If I do how will rent qet paid paid
So now I'm thinkin dat
2OO stacks wat wuld it bring me back
Espically now dat reseccions hit
My only answer to my question is is
Okay now here is a thought
Streets is a marriage that u can divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love
So I treat the game just like I'm selling drugs, drugs

(Trick trigga uh songz aye)
Tell me what's happening
I'm addicted to plastering
These rappers beats with my vocals
What happens when I'm ask 2 sing
No problem on instrumentals
I guess they ask 4 me
Then I answer give em cancer
And they come back for me
So why they mad at me
Cause my mental compacity
Get to over lapping them bastards
The audasity haters even clap 4 me
Realizing actually I represent the betterment
And they just late like letterman, man
Trey Song Page Long
List of who I'm better than
Contact my d a zon
I might need excederin
Sicker than I eva been
They won't me instead of em
And if they dislike it
I'm letting them so let em in (Come on)
Guess I'm spose to let em win
If u was to bet again
It be best if you would just
Put paper on the medicine
I'll let u know
I walk all thrrough ya vestibule
I guess u know I'll stretch ya hole
Her love drip on my testicals
T.M.I. but he is I
And I am him flying then
Perpellers u so jealous
You can tell us jus e mail us
I'm a problem no use in hatan
There ain't no calculating
I'm so nasty on the beat
Jus like a freak that's masterbatin
Be makin fashin statements
When I leave my place of residence
Feel like I'm intelligent
And everybody is hella dence
Irrelavent and the only exception is
My relevance u lookin at the future
If ever I'm in ya presence shit
Hated right trey be like
Haters get ya paper right
Swear u fly tellin lies
Couldn't live a faker life
They love it shout out
To kid cudi I like the little lovely
And ya city something pretty
Y da kids call u ugly
Man I'm buggin I be tripping
I be playing but they listening
I'm saying what the bidness
What u missing I'm the illest
I do this n my free time
Man u can search
But you will never
Find a week line

He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shake.
Within his dreams he sees the life he made.

The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
It seems the feelings that she had are through.

I feel so caught up in a bud, I flow some out of my bedroom
Turn around see myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool

And no sappy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan minus the tights and the purse
Happy to see how far I've come to the same place it began
My dreams, imaginations perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up, up and away, up, up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up, up and away, up, up and away

I could take care of my mom and my little niece
So sing along lil' mama you
Ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no

I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
Cleveland city grinding man
Stay afloat the kids hope
I never let a motherfucker break me dogg

Who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steeds
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-Ts
We don't care what people say
Dude, you could take the clothes most day

I ain't gotta wait for no one

A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself

She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A poker face book, I already read it

But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South lookin' for a payday
Said ""Bitch you should do it for the love like Ray J""

But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right and get up on this conscious dick

A little nigga wit' a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found

Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of the sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and trail of places

That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul attack
Now I'm heard all over the map

Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you're gon' go
Maybe upstate for some

But you can't rule out these claps for gun
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
So maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Been pimpin' you should think about marriage

Until then get it then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute, I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zone and see things so vivid

Hide my soul? Nah homie, not even
I'ma zone out till I lose feeling
Remember, I'ma be gone way past November
Even stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin' I could find peace somewhere

Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Comma's on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland city we ride around

Greetin' my niggas wit' dap and pounds
So if I fall I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while

I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight

Man, everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes they will love it

If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am fadin' man
Doin' other shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't just standin' 'round hatin'

So my advice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin' all alone
And then the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'

And the devil in a hot pink dress
Tryin' to ask me for one dance
He think he slick but my guardians
Protect me from his wrath
So in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin' I will find peace somewhere

In my mind it sounds like, ooh
When I'm gone it feels like, ooh

When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zone, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright

 Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
 Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
 Money neva change me only change the situation
 The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
 Started from the pavement, basement Satan,
 Couldn't match my claims so they compare me to a mason
 Free [?] slaves but they based and crazy
 We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
 So for the blunted, then they pickin the gun up
 Motherfuckers is trippin if it in in the run up
 Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
 And they do with the sun up
 And this is for my niggas and my gang
 Through the fortune and the fame
 Only thing didn't change was my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
 I got the niggas that I need with me
 Any issues my nigga you know then please hit me
 No question no hesitation when it come to own fam dawg,
 If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
 Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
 You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
 No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
 I do got the ones that do know Scott
 They give me the love that a nigga need
 If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
 Word to dennis
 Brought me thick and thin 'til we finished
 Focused to keep the pockets replenished
 Clothes on our kids
 And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
 Only wanted fly shit when we got big
 Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
 Beat niggas up so [?] it they go blind about it
 We all grown, families up on our own
 Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
 So long as I am my brotha's keeper
 He will provide me with a [?] or a street sweeper
 The love I have for my niggas is another type
 You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
 Love for my niggas,
 The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

(Hello-
What it be
To you and yours)

Salutations to all you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant cause I’m getting my money.
Way my doors are swayin’ its like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new new here
It’s gona take you beyond
Where a jet can leer
But all you gon’ hear is something crazy in fact
How I be burning the booth
We’ll get you looser than Yak.

Yep yep… you got it…right.
Now dont get left get on your good foot its only right.
That you step and keep boppin’ til this shit unfamiliar
If you main line got time then i be drillen’ her.
I keep you in my realm i keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high because the haze by the pound. (whaa?)
And my imagination you can look all over the nation
But they ain’t see

(Hook)
You can look all over but you’ll never find
(hot shit) like mine
WOOP…. it blow your mind.

You can look all over but you’ll never find
(hot shit) like mine
Cause I provide
That new new

Salutations my niggaz
I’m aware that I’m different
You can still keep it hood
While you’re smoking just listen
It dont matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon rock
Gota keep up the pace
And the girls gon twerk it
Cause the vibe is poppin’
As well as the bottle
Keep it rockin’ don’t stop em
At the motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggaz will front

Yeah cause Im super-cut-lery-alistic-leaner-ala-docis
And rap ferocious I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public if you love it M dub it
Blood sweat and tears homie im made of it
Finish the class if you think nothin bout it
Tell em that grandpa you don’t know nothin bout it
Wear kicks once then the leaner come up out em
I been saying it, you waz playin em
Now you know.

(Hook)

What it be to my ladies
With the bodies that kill
We were boppin on money
Fuck with me cause you’re real
See you shakin’ it fast
On some mystikal shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It’s that Henney and Cocoa-Cola
Come over and sit
Won’t you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don’t wanna hear that

You see I ain’t for a check before
I aint for sex
Niggaz aim for death
They tryin to fuck with the blessed
Ain’t no fuckin with amateurs
Run past the novas
Sip hella lean
And see who talks the slowest
Ain’t no stopping me at all
You need to saw it off with maybe a chainsaw
And even if that
The crack that I brew is still new
You guys think acute but Cudi is obtuse",Rap

And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed indeed just what I need
How I feel upon a time so recent in time make me sad

When I recollect how it use to be
Like David and Goliath kinda like me and the devil
Tryna rip out my soul, tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no, no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in hell

At the end of the day, day my momma told me
Don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At end of the day, day, nobody, nobody
Ever could stop me, ever could stop me

At the end of the day, day you can't regret it
If you were trying, if you were trying

Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream
I seem to glide above my horror though
I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow

To proceed and remain intact my mental was so unstable
And they talk and judge a man they have no clue of what I'm capable
Till I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told ya, no, I'm not no loser I'll see you in hell

I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing no cash or check could be more blessed
And if you would've seen the things I've seen up in my stumble?
You'd be shook stay awake no need to run your fate will follow you

You should know not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal a simple code I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to hell, no

At the end of the day, day my momma told me
Don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At end of the day, day, nobody, nobody

'Bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months

Don't let these hoes bother me

I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face
I'm like okay
I'll let him did what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills

If you a pussy you get popped
You a groupie, you a opp
Bet you come around my way
You can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts
Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip
I bet, you dip, he dip, she dip
I say, I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No - I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they ni**as is safe

I go to dinner & steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Roly got charms, look like frosted flakes
I had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott

I'm alright

Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwing deals from left to right
But I ain't giving in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doing
Shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hating bitch
Talking shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm sucking dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fucking lit
And don't be talking all that sorry shit
Don't flip the script
I see the lights
I hear the hype
I hit the mic
I kill the show
I get my dough
I catch a flight
I see a hater
I'm running down
It's on sight
I throw my hands
I hit em' left
I hit em' right

They sleeping on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowing up my phone
Saying everything I touch is lit
Acting cool and wanna fuck me
Like they wasn't talking shit
I let em' live
Let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show em' what it is
Don't got the bat?
Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time
I ain't never been no average bitch

Not to mention
I did my tour and that shit was winning
Independent, the headline
Award of feeling
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans
They fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up?
Look exhausted
Wave the white flag
Girl, you might as well just forfeit

My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now
Lookie now
Nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought?
Yeah, you really lost
Now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga
I was always on my shit
I used to stare at magazines
On the train
Looking at these models
Like ""I gotta be this one day""
Fuck around
Got myself a name
Now I'm getting paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave

Be careful, be careful, be careful with me
Look

I wanna get married, like the Curry's, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly; Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout liking pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though
Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune,
but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name
Watch her, 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's plain disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news
I started speaking my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right
Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life
Get money, go hard, damn fucking right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite
Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory
I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just trying to chill and make bangers""
Tell all these old bitches they in danger
The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape
That's what I call a fucking waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what?
I think ya got your story screwed up
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough
I'm the one that's killing shit, hands down
If you got a problem with me, say it now
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights
I'm stepping out every day, prom night
So if it's all love, show me love then
'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun
And we all know you ain't that tight
I smack you and the bitch that you act like
I started getting money, bitches upset
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced
Come through shinning with them Rollies bust face
Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since 08'
I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch
Whole life been through some fucked up shit
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this
I walked into the label, ""where the check at?""
Cardi B on the charts, you can expect that
Where that bitch that was claiming she a threat?
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say, I'm too ratchet
They say, I act wild
I'm Chyna wit' the porn
Like a bad ass child
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now

I just want to break up all your shit
Call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch
Then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around acting like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'gram?
Little bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holding back everything that's inside of me
How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
(You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping)
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh

All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, Resentment on repeat
I'mma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like,
Here you go, nigga, bon appétit
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eating me, you sleeping peacefully
Getting more mad at you, thinking 'bout stabbing you
Don't even know that you this close to dying
You gon' wake up like,
Why you got an attitude?

Since the run, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique

Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before now they booking me
The glow that bitches so shook at me
They like, ""Shit, Cardi B what you cooking bih?""
I say, ""Bitches, got me on some new shit""
I swear niggas got me feeling ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walking in the stores, I couldn't buy nothing
They look at me staring
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, ""Gimme my money!
Why the fuck you asking all this info?""

Run up get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grinding all night
Didn't sleep till the sun up

Tell 'em, ""Fall back""
All must recline
Bitches mad as fuck
But I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it
Better soak it up
Looking like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was making no move?
Thought I was gon' be living in Sues?
Thought I was making no money?
You fucking thought I was gon' lose
Everything now that I swear I got pay
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate

Got shooters ready for a come up

In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling

Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated

Everything they deprived me of

In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

S on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
'Cause I'm the one like I'm Tracy McGrady
And I think I love him like Eminem is calling Shady

Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam
Hot damn, make me scream like summer jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

S on my chest, let me get my cape on
With a certificate that I change my name on
N-n-n-name on
With a certificate that I change my name on

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride

The good advice, I always hated
But looking back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up

Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no, you ain't buying
I tried to fight it back with defiance

You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yelling at you and getting at you
Picking up dishes, throwing them at you
Why are you speaking when no one asked you?

Always get the reaction you wanted

Tired of letting passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul

Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal

Took him out to Belgium, welcome

This box better than the box he was held in

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her with her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin' back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves, steal your hearts with ease

[Verse 2: ~Gudda Gudda~]
I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way
I'm that red bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place with all kinds of space
I'll let you be the judge and I'm the case

Be on my low scrunch
Be on my ecko whites
He say nicki don't stop you the bestest
And I just be coming off the top as bestest

[Verse 4: ~Drake~]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, shake and bake, ricky bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody
I see them standing in line, just to get beside her
I let her see the aston or let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl, I thought I recognized her

She like tannin', I like stayin' in
She like romancin', I like rollin' with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscios is
She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN
But when that show ends, she all in my skin lotion
No emotions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4])
She pause like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this
I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: ~Jae Millz~]
She ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss independent yea she got her own
Hey gorgoues, umm, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it, this how I call it
Yea, look at how she walk, who knew she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't leaving fast, I'm a stay a while

Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, and 2 mill in Mercedes
I get hit from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rhianna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking play off seat
Know that boy busy balling I like to play all week
Monday night with the rawI'm Vince McMahon with the beat
Power slamming them hammers I get you handle for free
So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet
Dm, in the bm, you cm, you... you love it
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick x 2
(Cam'Ron)
See the car is European but got imported from tokyo
Looking like a shark, the nose call it pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, lv, logo
Middle of july but the wrist on snowfloor
Only do the aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you my son 
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin
She said you're only Cameron
Girlfriend you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl watch your manners
She run and tell here mama, I think I love him, Nana
Because you sat upon my lap
Nah, I ain't Santa hope they call me my...
Even do... why would I fight her, don't even like her

The best B in the league inevitably
But could it be little me, you was heckling me
Now it's monotony when I regularly

I catch wreck on recreation
So I exceed all your expectations
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract is on but I am the addendum

So where my dawgs at, Randy
Matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
'Cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi

Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron

I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel

Muthafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire

I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it

And she let him back in and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end

I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is a phase, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per- unh, Prada colored babes

494,Nicki Minaj,http://www.songlyrics.com/nicki-minaj/press-conference-lyrics/,"[Charlamagne]
Let’s talk about New York City.
I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn’t rep New York.
I say ""What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.""

[Nicki Minaj]
Y’all don’t want me to rep y’all.
Y’all don’t hear when I rep y’all 'cause y’all be dick-riding everybody else.

Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?
Hell fucking no.
I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers.
You came up on mixtapes like everyone else...

I was selling my mixtape out of my muthafucking BMW out on Jamaica muthafuckin’ Avenue to Amadue and Hussaine and all them.
Fuck you niggas!
You niggas don’t know the half of what I’ve been through!

[Charlemagne]
What do you say to people that say you’re trying to be something that you’re not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you’re doing things for shock value?

Well, I don’t know.
In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they’re going to tell me I can’t do that 'cause another bitch did it.

[Safaree ""SB Samuels]
Stupid ass bitches!
People compare her to everybody.
Nicki gets it so hard!

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don’t understand something they have to compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that.
For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison and I always say, even though it’s very common, it’s just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it’s the first time.
It is what it is but even she gets compared to Madonna and it’s a never-ending cycle but I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that’s won then compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed.

[Nicki Minaj]
It’s easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner.

[Charlemagne]
Do you ever look back at some of your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool""?

[Nicki Minaj]
Yes I do!

You know what I like about superstars?
I like my superstars to be out there.
Be like Prince with your ass out.
I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you’re a superstar.

That’s how I want to see my superstars.
I don’t want to see my superstars regular.
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater.
I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.

I did that because my passion was acting.
When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn’t really be myself.
When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself.
I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj.
I can now really bring me into it.
And I think that’s where the confusion lies is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety.
But that wasn’t. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is a more multi-faceted mixture of all the different personalities that I have in me.
I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn’t be doing justice to all the people who feel like I do.
'Cause for every person who doesn’t understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what’s wrong with that?

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that pop Nicki and mixtape Nicki can exist in the same space?

[Nicki Minaj]
They already are and they are both winning.

If it’s one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile.
She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.
Right, because you can’t do too much of either, you really can’t.

It’s unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental to your future.
It’s detrimental for your growth.
It’s detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman; I’m not talking about as a man because we’ve seen The Blueprint with Jay.
We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop.
We have not seen that with a woman so show me the blueprint.
That’s all I want you to do – show me the blueprint.

I think you are creating it, because Queen Latifah doesn’t exist in that space anymore.
She went on to become an actress
Queen Latifah is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I mean I wanna be 40 years old rapping. I — the hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I’m 40 years old rapping.
So I’m going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen.""
Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons — is she a sellout or is she winning?

So these other bitches that only did rap and now they’re washed, and they’re living in, you know, low income housing — is that winning?
Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap?
The same niggas that didn’t buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit?
Get the fuck out of here.

[Charlemagne]
Any regrets?

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment as I should have.

On what she would like to do outside of rap, her bigger purpose.
I have to pray on that.
I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans really...
I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain.
I don’t feel like that ever happened.
Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we’re out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I’m good,"" and I don’t want my fans to think like that.

One day, you’re going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could’ve been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?""
We got so many girls right now having children and don’t even know the first thing to say to a child.

You’re having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened.
I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that.
We’re the ones in control again.
Why are we never in control?

Why are we stuck with a baby?
Why are we always stuck on the welfare line?
Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children?
Why do we think it’s something wrong for waiting to have a baby?

Waiting until you’re 35 or 36 to have children; technology has changed – you can wait.
Have something to offer them.
That’s something that’s dear to my heart.
Doing something that make children feel like I don’t have to rush to grow up.
I can enjoy my childhood.

[Charlemagne]
How did you escape being more than just an ass?
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

[Safaree ""SB"" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that?

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.
People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that’s won.
It’s very hard, mentally, this shit is draining.
For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain’t getting to you, it’s draining.

It’s crazy.
That’s why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics.
When I was coming up, I never understood it.
I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don’t they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?""
He’s like, ""Yup, now let’s see who really want it.""
I think I became more than that, because people cannot deny...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit.
Say it!
You don’t have to be humble.
Be like Ray J.
""I’m tired of being humble.""

Oh baby like it raw with a shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, ASAP get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Getting figures and fuckin bitches, she rollin' swishers
 Brought her bitches, I brought my niggas, they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
But at least a nigga nigga rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out have her fuckin' boys, beast

 [Verse 2: Drake]
I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leading on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fucking read-along
Ain't a fucking sing-along unless you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, okay, okay)
 Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
 I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talking, I beast

 [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
 Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
AKA Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to a par
 See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say

 Holla back I'll do ya, beast

Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary 
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready 
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries 
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready? 
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about 
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out 
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang 
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang 
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling 
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 train 
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar- 
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard 
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard 
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws 

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] 
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at 
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard 
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""DOO DOO!"" I hate y'all 
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,"" let's play ball 
In a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold, I rhyme cold 
My K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9 drone 
That banana clip, straight from the rip 
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit 
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over 
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was 
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier 
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya 
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta 
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this 
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist 
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff 

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$] 
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience 
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches 
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons 
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms 
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms 
The violence and the killin', so given 
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance 
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet 
But pass the pot let me skillet 
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga 
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc 
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks 
And I swear it hurt me soul 
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales 
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail 
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real 

[Verse 4: Yelawolf] 
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers 
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it 
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin' 
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in 
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others 
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble 
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's 
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again 
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold 
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck 
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us? 
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a 
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow! 
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot 
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze 
And thawed out for spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf 

[Verse 5: Danny Brown] 
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties 
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries 
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers 
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on 
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin 
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis 
Bitch when I say this I mean this: ""Ho, I'm the meanest"" 
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus 
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch 
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit 
That is my synopsis, ostrich pot shit 
Hoes on some God shit, stop it! You not this! 
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward 
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert 
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic 
Just bein honest, tell me, isn't that ironic? 

[Verse 6: Action Bronson] 
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860 
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me 
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me 
You should've stayed with me 
Now many Asian bitches lay with me 
The face is silky like a tablecloth 
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse 
Red roses drop on boxes very often 
Confetti torture, drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton 
Outstandin' 
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling 
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon 
The cloud of smoke like the phantom 
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic 
You see me comin' through in each state 
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake 
Cuffed to my wrist I've got the briefcase 
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham 

[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.] 
Big KRIT, shawty 
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep 
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats 
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like,How you ask for that? 
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch? 
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack 
All I wanted was love, all they had was doubt 
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins 
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch 
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships 
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with 
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxing if you want a hit 
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here 
Been a killer, ...86er, nigga, that's my born year 
Get the fuck from ...round here, that's just my country ways 
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade 
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades 
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass 
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me? 
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album 
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you? 
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too 
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past 
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey's ass 
That's out of line, but in living color? 
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist",Rap

Pass the pass the pass the muthafuckin swisher
Pour some muthafuckin liquor
For my muthafuckin niggas
Who ain't with us, keep it trilla

With my gold teeth and my french braids
Been getting dough since the 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind not the pocket
If that's the case, then I been paid

Herringbone Chain
My gold frames
My Cartiers
You small change
You bitch made
I'm old school
Like dempstars and switch blades
I spit game
I get paid
I pimp game, my pimp
I be that pretty muthafucka, ASAP is just my nickname

[Screwed:]
I'm coming down when I'm tippin on them 4's
Cause we shittin on we shittin on these niggas and these hoes

Cause that purp shit, I sip up
Your big shows, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked
I'm draped out and drip dripped up

Top of the top of the line
All on my grind, purple be easing my mind
They runnin and they runnin we gunnin we gunnin
We gonna hit one at a time-time

Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
A weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: ASAP Twelvy]
All theses boppers wanna bop em
Niggas wanna jock em
Not a red light horus city cop that can stop em

Going broke is not an option
Always on that cash flow
She used to call me ass hole
Now she drop that ass low

Fuck it man, I'm past doe
Sour diesel, stash coke
ASAP, we the last hope
Fuck it, dis my fast flow

I slow it down, I pick it up
Blue jeans, I rip em up
That's swag, bitch
You mad, bitch
See you in my past bitch

I'm headed to the future
Twelvy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup
Call it Punky Brewster?

I'm slurring, wassup
Don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit
But man, I'm really fucked up

I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I'll see you when the sun's up
Young niggas run everything
ASAP to the top and these bitches love everything

[Verse 3: ASAP Nast]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah

Yo bitch, I'm in bed with her
Head so good, make a nigga feel good
'Till the point I wanna marry her

But I be on my pimpin shit
Check out my limp 'need shit
I be gettin money gettin money, can you dig it bitch

Ho get on my pimpin ship, all aboard all aboard
East coast muthafuckas makin all the noise all the noise

I know you niggas heard of us
Raff Simon murderers
Fashion killa, word to bigga boss I never heard of ya

Still sippin, candy painted whips is what I'm sittin in
Kitchen Kim is whippin up that shit to get these bitches here

New York nasty flow t
That's a little bit of crack mixed in with a 5th of hen
Businessmen, middle finger to your fuckin buisiness, man

Ray Da Vinci shit?
Rollercoaster, take a flick of this
Motion picture shit
Bitch I grind like a skater do
Always strive and prosper
A new level we gon take it to",Rap

I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave?
Always come back, cause you wanna fuck
Always come back, cause you wanna fuss
Holding back, ain’t no turning back when you fall in love
Know it happens everytime you speak
Always fall flat cause you on the rush
Uh, so you can take it slow
Separate the highs from the low
Separate the evens from the odds
Like something pull me back together when I come apart

(Florence Welch)

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

I woke up today, I felt a little less pressure for me
And I mean to say I, may you even learn the lesson for me
If you find the way to fight the pain,
If you fly away, you rest assure

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

(ASAP Rocky)

You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on the left titty

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the ṗressure

Smokin rollin reefer up I adjust the tweakers up
Break it break it down break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? where the welcome at? my sneaker tough
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
Rocky where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cope that bathin ape or jeremy scott or 10 deep
Bottles full of rose ridin in the benz jeep
Blowin money fast now im finna think im big meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fiine there are bad days you feel like givin up
Like how you gon eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
Cause I just came here down south so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
And my beats bangin kickin harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

Life is just a bitch a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money money come and goes
Friends turn to foes foes they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight

Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me bout that rappin trappin in the old days
When pop homeboy shock before that rat tat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sippin on somethin purpler than soul plane
We sip slow slow swing tip fos and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang hold up thats my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back miss me and I miss you back
She said harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap

Tap the vein, let it stream, feel the pain

We can make it with this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in Manhattan

Outkast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre 
Beef is on my entrée, Gin & Juice, that’s Bombay 
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one way 
Pussy on a Sunday, fitness on a Monday 
My new crib came with a feng shui in my closets like a runway 
Come be my fiancée, she fuck me in a Hyundai 
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe 
Finna date for 1K, shopping date for 2K 
Hoopty ass bitch, made me wait to fuck for 2 days 
Finally got the toobey, swear to God my mood changed 
Top off like toupees, drive off, touché 
Yea my mouth is full of gold and I’m a city boy 
And my outfit was in Vogue, I’m a pretty boy 
Bounce what? Flocka tell em holla at a nigga G 
Riding on Miami mix, here’s my ghetto symphony 

Rippin, with me, my mama as a witness 
Bitches knickin and lockin up my swishas 
Once you blow my whistle, she know it’s the swistles 
Spread the news, I’m official, now hop out my foreign vessel 
Before I get aggressive, forget it, war ready 
Already tested, tears and blood invested 
Til my cardiac’s arrested and my 40 ounces empty 
Show me what you owe me and appoint a house with that 
Black magic on the ties, only I 
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile 
One, police on me now, still torn 
And my chain and my stony dow cheerful 
Pain, in it's purest form 
Don’t complain, I came to reign 
From here forth, still lord 
So the crib got cleared for us 
Burning planes in my airforce 
And all I can see is clear porch 

Since Rocky spit like Andre I’m gon kill it like Big Boi 
These rappers is on my entrée, 
You don’t like cookies, chips ahoy 
Eatin joy when I get annoyed, no cover niggas that I kill for joy 
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid 
Money get style, my lil fishin boy 
Arnold Schwarzeneger, toss a nigga 
Like codein mixed with a Roy 
Smoke what make a nigga trip collide 
What took me how fast, you could grip a 9 
Damn, nigga I doubt they tell this my heart 
And the motherfuckers come in to cry 
You niggas have a sour dipped in wine 
Guess that’s when a girl sip the white 
Pourin liq so I soak in different shine 
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky 
My soul get cold, all my niggas died 
So and so, niggas live and die 
Beneath choose souls you will reside

Tryina come with this for their freakin lives

Feelin out of place, plus its gettin kinda late
Tryna make it home safe, and I get raped. Where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffin dope, so Odoma's leanin' on the rib[?]
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped you friends
Flag a taxi. Now you walkin not too far from your crib
Cravin for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feelin flabbergasted you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th ave. Flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid french braids and he keep it potent?
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rollin' reefer blowin in the streets he smokin
Blowin weed while police patrollin
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell my nigga quit the bitching and we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Rolling blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause everyday we oughta have pesos

Cause everyday we oughta have pesos

Your bitches said that I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She going really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch double D
Popping E I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga this is what I breath

El Peine De Los Vientos
Tu, tu y yo
rozamos la verdad, la luz, la eternidad 
y detras solo el mar, que fue testigo fiel
de que deje la piel yo por ti justo alli
y al fondo el metal retorcido y real como lo eres tu
el peine de los vientos recordara, no olvidara.

Sabor a sal, agua y metal
sabor a ti que aun sigue alli
sombras de amor
hierros de dolor, hierros de dolor.

Tu, solo tu
supiste comprender, tocar ver y creer
y detras nada mas que el tiempo y el lugar
y el mar queriendo hablar para ti, para mi
frio metal, niebla irreal viento y rock and roll
El peine de los vientos, secreto infiel, guardado en el 

Te favorece la vejez que veo desde aquella vez
fuego inmortal del color del mar, del color del mar

Sabor a sal, agua y metal
sabor a ti que aun sigue alli
sombras de amor
hierros de dolor, hierros de dolor.",Rap

I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, ""Achoo""
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm Flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
Hold up wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm the lieutenant
I'm the type to count a million cash then grind like I'm broke
That Lambo, my new bitch, she'll ride like my ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hands strapped around my toast
Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
Cause my momma need that bill money and my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke
All I know is murder, when it comes to me
I got young niggas that's rollin' I got niggas throwin' b's
I done did the DOAs, I done did the KODs
Every time I'm in that bitch I get to throwin' 30 G's
Now I'm hanging out that drop head, I'm riding down on Collins
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas and we mobbin', like Batman and we're robbin' (Robin)
This 2-door Maybach, with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like real nigga what up, real nigga what up
If you ain't about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in yo' raps, I'll get your pussy ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwing deuces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city cause I'm still calling them shots
And these lames talking that bullshit the same niggas that flock
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hating on me, hoes waiting on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money have ya friends turn into enemies
And with these beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go from 40 ain't no 10 a key, hold up
Broke nigga turn rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?

Had me feeling like that dope boy when he first touched that brick

And I heard you niggas talking money, you should stop, boy

I fuck bitches by the group, I get money by the pound
French Montana on all these niggas ch-ch-chop 'em down
Every time I'm in the club these niggas is not around
Everybody talking money, I say prove it not a sound

White girls gone wild
We don't judge 'em though, they ain't on trial
Bad bitches got 'em on dial
It's bottoms up but it's going down

Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party

Ciroc all on my table, bitches in the living room
They gon' ask who at the door, tryna get in too
Only me and my niggas, tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin' models, watching all in my living room

Welcome to my house party, party

[Intro: Meek Mill]
One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first
Looking at me ballin, know that instagram hurt
Cuz you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same herse
Same cemetary, burry me in the same dirt
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work
""B.H we straight,"" that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do?
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was yellin free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I don't even stop, ain't a need to
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you
Shit got realer, niggas got richer
I said the money train coming, niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They want more than my mother
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all
Cuz none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet
Gone

[Hook]

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I still love niggas
But its like we just grew apart
If you don't grind, you don't shine
Half my niggas still around, and we all shining hard

Tre pound, crack crown
Meek Milly, Bloodhound
Grimy, thirsty, 'bout it you heard me
Glizzy on de-deck

Looking for these fuck boys to do these niggas dirty
Ya play tough I dare you
My goons, they balloon shit air you
Nah nigga I ain't trying to hear you
And I don't need no four pound cause I ain't trying to scare you
I just take the nina raw, get up on you near you
Action 40 lightning bloody near you, tear you
My niggas be riding low
Tinted with them choppers though
We spin yo block my Mr. Softee, spot you like a domino
Simon say he want you dead, I say that you got to go
So we gone drop some shit on you geronimo, asap
Make that nigga Diddy bop take that, take that
Send him on a trip without a space pack, bow
My hood like goons gone wild
Where Ernie said he don't want no beef he want a cow
A fool with them tools we don't even let him touch them
Get freaky with them heaters he be trying to finger fuck them
Niggas creeping in my main yard, peeking through the window
Bird hunting like the gun game on Nintendo
Wish that I was there I probably would've let them in though
And stretch one of them nigga like a limo
Trying score a touchdown, nigga fuck around and catch an [?]
Cause I ain't never go to sleep n-o, [?]
Can't get behind me cause my back to the wizal
Gat in my jizalls, ready to clap izall
They gon' murder me so I got to murder them first
And I gon' kill his brother cousin, him first
Give them niggas brim work, chest work
They say that that's the best work
So I'm gon' gun them down like an expert, tise
Aiming at chu and my mac gon' sneeze
My refrigerator put you on freeze
Fuck out of here
We do them niggas right and get up out of there
Same place you put your hat my niggas throwing hollows there

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
I'm loading up the oo-wop
Listening to 2Pac
I'm a dope boy so the money in the shoe box
A hundred grand large, all off of hard
I don't fuck with rappers all y'all frauds
Calling all cars, AR-AB got a gun
Crack in the bag cause AR-AB got a son
And he got to eat, by any means
I got two things, fuck a hoop dream
Make it to the NBA that's a pipe dream
They end up smoking rock out of pipe screen
I play the night scene, hard rock pitching
Forty-four with the long nose Scott Pippen
I put it on the line, I put it on my mom
I've been shooting niggas since they put it in my palm
Put it in my hands, them cooked up grams
Where I'm from all the drug dealers was the man
So fuck a rap buzz, I got a rap sheet
I'm a legend in jail, and trap streets
[?] like AR-AB just chill
You just beat a body and you still trying to kill
They talking to a deaf man, forty in my left hand
Give a nigga wig shots then look for the next man
I shoot 'til the tec jam, then pass [?]
A lord take my soul if AR-AB [?]
Trying to rob AR-AB niggas asking to die
Last nigga tried I was booking that five
Years in the cell, I called my little brother
He hit both witness, then I got acquitted
I wave one hand and my niggas tilt heads
I tell them break a leg I ain't talking show biz
I talking your kids, I make them show ribs

I’ma chase my dream
Coming to America like Prince Akeem
I aint never give a f-ck then I seen
High definition to get whats forever given
But nothin was never given
I build it from ground up
I started out form my basement and builded my house up
I’m rich off opportunity, money gon’ pile up
My swag on a hundred mill, how the stylist gon style us
Caught up in the light, caught up in the life
I see young’in on the corner with a quarter of that white
He just tryna chase his dream plus his daughter needs some wipes
And some pampers so he don’t give a f-ck about the slammer
He just tryna stay alive, clutching on his hammer
World full of problems, aint nobody gotta answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin’ high
Bills steady rollin’ in, he barely gttin’ by
Same clothes everyday, he barely gettin’ fly
Erryday he wake, he just swear to do his job
What that is? Chasin’ dreams, time is tickin’ so it seems
On his downtime he’s spittin’and he’s sick, his flow is mean
He just want his real chance, no reality show
But the graveyard the jail cell, reality though
Crack house was his crib, the streets fathered him tho
And he aint got no twitter page but you can follow him tho
Woah

Pop used to beat her
Got a sister my age, my pop was a cheater
Gram’s kept something in the pot for us to eat up
Had to open up the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, no birthday’s or Easter’s
Used to snatch bags from Halloween trick or treaters
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
Shared the same bed that my cousin used to pee in
Dreamed to be the Huxtable’s, settled for the Brady’s
Black and white on top of floor model wit’ no cable
My sister used to punch me, beat me, slap me
Caught my first case stealin’ cookies outta ackney?
Raised in South Phil, 2-4 where you can find me at
Used to kick the machines for quarters out the laundromat
Dirty little teen, giong to school embarrassin’
Gas cut off, my clothes smelling like kerosene

It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Started thinkin’ bout things I never had
Was broke as a joke, aint never laugh
I woke up and went and got it, now they forever mad
How can you hate me where I came from
When just a year ago I was the same one
Them dudes you call your homies be the main one
You’d be surprised what niggas do as soon as the fame come
But I aint worried, discouraged, I just observe it
When my dreams started to crumble, niggas deserted
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
But now I’m gettin’ to it, niggas act like they deserve it
Sittin’ in my cell, watching my dream
Fade like Mike, fourth quarter, tie game
Shackles on my ankles and wrist my first chains
And now it’s hard work on the menu, I thirst cream

Grind will turn into your shine, be patient

Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that rose. Lord Knows!

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in the ass and she heard them pipes they was growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' leer in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder, ball horrible out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes
Hella Jewels, Money come in different revenues
Big Paper, your money smaller then that Kevin dude

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm really getting mad money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate
They call me racked up shorty, she can smell the Aura
Had her out in Bora exploring like she was Dora
Million dollar sponsor, spoiled her like my daughter
And put her in the game, She ain't fucking with lames ",Rap

Come on y'all, Light up a candle
This ones for everybody that lost somebody
From the cribs to the grave to the end of the road
May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This for my niggas on the other side
That died young and didn't make it out to see 25
Fell victim to a homicide
Murder seen yellow tape
Family members momma cry
Same scenario, it's scary though
Happenin' in the hood every day but we don't fear it though
Rest in peace to these obituaries like a merry-go
Cause it's goin round and round
State to state, town to town
Every minute on the clock somebody heart stop
And every day thats year someone disappear
Thinkin' on the days they coulda hit me there
No religion prayin god was good enough to keep me here
My dad died when I was young
Seen the casket rollin down into the ground, I was done
Dark nights their, turned me into a moon instead of sun
To goon instead of young nigga with a school dream

[Verse 2: Ms. Jade]

Me ask me was I gon' cry
Motherfuckin right I will
I was cryin in the parkin lot
Tear on the steerin' wheel
Shades on so no one would see my eyes puffy
2 months since I'm changin'
I still ain't over it
No I ain't finished mournin'
Cryin like every morning
Think about her everyday
Wishin I was in the moment
Wishin she was still here instead of these lame niggas
Why the fuck they still here
Why he have to take my sister
To see you on
Yeah I know I gotta do it
So I drink to take the pain away
Stop me from goin' through it
But it don't and it can't
And they never understand
They shot my best friend in the head
She ain't even have a chance
Ain't never get to get married
Never get to give birth
Never get to see me make it
And man this shit hurt
Uh but ride along, lay up song
Ain't plan on gettin on this song
But I did it for her

And I, don’t mind, calling when I’m late just to give you peace of mind
And I, don’t mind, you staying out all night long hanging with the guys
But I do mind, when you look me right dead in the eye and you tell me lies

You see it pays to tell the truth
Look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth, feel so sorry for you
You could've had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, now you leave with zero (nothing)
Now you leave with zero (nada)
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Now you live with zero (nothing)
Now you leave with zero (oh nada)
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth

Oh why I tried, giving you chances just to get your act right
And I, I tried, everything from praying to breaking things
For getting out of line
Those tears I've cried, they hurts so deep inside
That almost drained me dry
But now, it’s time, for you to man up cause I’m taking back what’s mine

You see it pays to tell the truth look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth, feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all, too bad you gotta fall

Now you leave with zero (nada)

You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Now you leave with zero (nothing)
Now you leave with zero (oh nada)
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth

I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you
Cause what we have was so 38 special
And it was times that I heard niggas test you
But I ain’t even ask, I was just waiting to catch you
But you caught me and everything was on me
It was time to face the music, everything was on key
And them lies sounded good, didn’t it
Now you sick of me, now I’m supposed to leave with zero, is you kidding me?
One minus one equals none
And if you gonna live then you might live with some
But you gonn think about me every time you see my son
And I’ma think about you every time I see the sun, in the morning
It’s gonna be times we get caught up in the moment
But don’t turn your back on your man you belong with
Cause if you loose then I loose too
But if you cool then I’m cool too

Now you leave, now you leave with zero (with nothing)
Now you leave with zero, (oh nada)
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Now you leave with zero, (oh nothing)

My diamonds all clear, smack my chain, you dead nigga
I don’t know what you heard, and I don’t know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk and all my dogs go hard (fuck that)
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like 36, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain’t have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty

 Check me,
 I from the city where the skinny niggas ride
 With a Semi.45 to make the biggest niggas fold up, roll up
 I done seen the realest niggas froze up
 When that Mack squeezing hollows in your back
 Leaking that, decent if you want to everytime I come through
 Everybody whispering, talking what gon do
 Hundred grand in straight cash
 Make me put it on you and have your own homies tryna swarm you
 I'm sworn to riding with this Glock.40
 And I got it on, too
 They tell me to put it down
 But they don't know what I'm going through
 Niggas playing checkers and it's chess
 So what's a pawn to a king that got his money right?
 You niggas on a hunger strike
 Now it's dead-broke, man, I used to grind a hundred a night
 A hundred day, selling white, I tell you it ain't nothing nice
 I be going so hard, man I don't see my son at night
 Baby mama bitching, I'm just trying to get my young'un right
 Started with a dollar to a half a ticket
 And I just signed my deal today
 For all you rapping niggas. Money ain't a joke
 You see me laughing niggas?
 All my goonies they ain't talking, they just clapping niggas
 You gonna think my dogg a roofer, brought a ladder with him
 My other homie a mechanic, got his ratchet with him
 And they shooting for real, they shooting to kill
 I got some mami's up state, they doing the will
 I remember niggas shooting for dear life
 30 years on us, cops pull at the red lights
 We riding with them hammers
 Know a couple young'uns that died before their grandma
 I'm not trying to play with hammers
 A lot of niggas fronted back when I was in the slammer
 But now I got that paper and I be going bananas
 Like Tony Montana, Nino and the Carter got me leaning even harder
 With this Nina in my cargoes
 I can't meet 'em any farther
 If the niggas want the work
 Tell 'em meet me out North, 20-something in birds
 Used to be with 50 niggas, 20 of 'em got murked
 20 done turned pussy, the other 10 put in work
 Yeah! I'm screaming ""this is the life""
 If you ain't hooping then you whipping the white
 They even hitting the white
 I talked to 'em try to give them advice

 Yea! Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right

I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&N make my hip limp
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips
And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip
I got drugs in the alley, no tip there

Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A
I want them birds 'til next May

This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits
Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick
I don't give no damn if they throw it off, I won't fuckin' miss
Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown, we ain't talk to him 'bout shit
Ya dig?",Rap
573,Young Thug,http://www.songlyrics.com/young-thug/our-bars-lyrics/,"New Bentley, not rentin it
Five hoes with me, they tricks
No splitin, bring it all
You trip pin, ho take it off
Let them folks see what you got
Take a nigga studio and bring it to my spot
Roc Crew will make yo block hot
Then hit the club and pop them pop them Xans
We Kind Krip Killas, not Ku Klux Klan
I promise I don't love that hoes, but I love my man dem
No homo tho, but I'm solo tho, cause thats how you get more dough tho
I had them bitches looking weird cause I let boo 4-4 shoe
I didn't have mine on me that day so JimBo had to kick door
You know we spend that cash everyday like we get 4-4 tho
And free Obama fuck them snitches haha like speedo

Shoutout to 1426, my left wrist is a half a brick
My right wrist is a whole brick, yo bitch on some more shit, umkay
Like young Future she know this, Im leaning with LeOtis
I fly past, you floatin, umkay
Yo young bitch with another bitch and another bitch and another bitch
And another bitch and another bitch, they gay
They ridin with Young Thug but they not get in big
They might get another to get braids like cliche",Rap
