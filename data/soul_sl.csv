0,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/as-lyrics/,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
(Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tommorow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know you're loved by somebody?)


Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
(Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
(Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you
(Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed


So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell

(I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
(Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

(Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left

(I'll be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
(Be loving you)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
(Be loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you
(Now ain't I loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

(Ain't I loving you?)
Until the ocean severs every mountain high
(I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

(Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the days that are no more
(Always)
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself

(Always)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you",Soul/R&B
1,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/i-just-called-to-say-i-love-you-lyrics/,"No new years's day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart
Of my heart",Soul/R&B
2,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/happy-birthday-lyrics/,"You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration

'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you

And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party
On the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition

'Cause it should never be
Just 'cause some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion

And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Why has there never been a holiday, yeah
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children

It should never be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people

So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday

We know the key to unify all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday

That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, yeah, yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be Heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah

4,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/overjoyed-lyrics/,"Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true, for did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true, for did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know for in romance all true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I, overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you",Soul/R&B
5,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/you-and-i-lyrics/,"Here we are on earth together, it's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side
To see me through until my life is through

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you

I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

'Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world

6,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/i-wish-lyrics/,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With boy thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go
Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go",Soul/R&B

For you there might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one who would break my heart in two

For you love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do

9,Stevie Wonder,http://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/living-for-the-city-lyrics/,"A boy is born
In hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls
That ain't so pretty

His parents give
Him love and affection
To keep him strong
Moving in the right direction

Living just enough
Just enough for the city, ee ha

His father works
Some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet
He barely makes a dollar

His mother goes
To scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe
She hardly gets a penny

Living just enough
Just enough for the city, yeah

His sister's black
But she is sho'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short
But Lord, her legs are sturdy

To walk to school
She's got to get up early
Her clothes are old
But never are they dirty

Living just enough
Just enough for the city, um hum

Her brother's smart
He's got more sense than many
His patience's long
But soon he won't have any

To find a job
Is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives
They don't use colored people

Living just enough
Just enough for the city

Living just enough for the city, ohh
Living just enough for the city, ohh
Living just enough for the city, ohh

His hair is long
His feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking
The streets of New York City

He's almost dead
From breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote
But to him there's no solution

Living just enough
Just enough for the city
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I hope you hear
Inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you
To make a better tomorrow

This place is cruel
No where could be much colder
If we don't change
The world will soon be over

Living just enough
Stop giving
Just enough for the city",Soul/R&B

When I do my love to you

When I hear you on the phone

Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

Girl, do I do, what you do

Two people vow to stay in love as one they say
But all is changed with time, the future none can see
The road you leave behind, ahead lies mystery
But all is fair in love, I had to go away

A writer takes his pen to write the words again
That all in love is fair

All of fate's a chance, it's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say in love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold, you either win or lose
When all is put away, the losing side I'll play
But all is fair in love, I should've never left your side

With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

Don't make it in the groove

When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers

And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out

With no vivid reason here to find

But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye 

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

There's songs to make you sad
But with an happy song to sing 
It never seems so bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me

I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Througout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart

Life began, then was done, 
Now I stare into a cold and empty well 

The many sounds that meet our ears 
the sights our eyes behold, 
Will open up our merging hearts, 
And feed our empty souls 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

Without despair we will share, 
And the joys of caring will not be replaced, 
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm, 
They won't be hard to find, 
And the words of love I speak to you 
will echo in your mind 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 

I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again, 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 

God surely answered my prayer, 
God surely answered by prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
God always will answer your prayers, 
Believe in one who will answer my prayer, 
Thank you God 

Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the woman I've been waiting for, 
Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the girl that I really adore, 
Come on, let's fall in love...[etc]",Soul/R&B

Strolling the summer days
Of imaginings in my head

Told only to the wind
Felt even without being said

That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet

Under a lover's tree
That's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the thought
Of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find

But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love

To go past yesterday and start living for today

One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see that place in time, so gold

Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever, and be in time, stay gold

But can it be when we can see
So vividly, a memory
And yes, you say, so must the day too fade away
And leave a ray of sun, so gold

Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined, all things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Oh gold",Soul/R&B

To know the love

Never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand

Made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile
That's blooming

And it's so clear to me
That you're a dream come true
There's no way
That I'll be losing

Turn me into your house clown

And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free!
A lasting blue note has been haunting me!
It's like an old mistress forever chasing me

But say no more
I may not be an easy man
But the way you played your hand
I couldn't stand!

It's too bad
There is much more we could have done!
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts!

Can you look back on what we built?

America The Beautiful



Oh beautiful, for heroes proved,
In liberating strife,
Who more than self, our country loved,
And mercy more than life,

America, America, may God thy gold refine,
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain devined.

And you know when I was in school,
We used to sing it something like this, listen here:

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties,
Above the fruited plain,

But now wait a minute, I'm talking about
America, sweet America,
You know, God done shed his grace on thee,
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in a brotherhood,
From sea to shining sea.

You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee)
America, I love you America, you see,
My God he done shed his grace on thee,
And you oughta love him for it,
Cause he, he, he, he, crowned thy good,
He told me he would, with brotherhood,
(From sea to shining sea).
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord
(Shining sea).",Soul/R&B

Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just and endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories

Sweet memories
Sweet memories

She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories

Sweet memories

And said ""Say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered ""God will keep us free""

They could hear the riders comin'
He said ""This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

There were seven Spanish Angels
At the altar of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish Angels
Took another Angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smokin' in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""

And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

There were seven Spanish Angels
At the altar of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish Angels
Took another Angel home

There were seven Spanish Angels
At the altar of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
Seven Spanish Angels
Took another Angel home

Busted



My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes and I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound, but I'm busted
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted.

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do,
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu,
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted.

Well, I am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow,
Me and my family got to pack up and go,
But I'll make a living, just where I don't know cause I'm busted.

'Cause everybody knows that nobody really knows
How to make it work or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try, one more try, one more try, one more try
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows

Oh, I wish you'd understand
Oh, just an ordinary man
Wish that we had known
Everybody knows but nobody really knows

And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you found somebody knew
I wish you the best, I guess

And all I own I'd love to give to you
Aren't you tired of going along this lonely road?
It takes its toll on you

Give me your emotion, your heart's devotion
Give anything you like
And I'll give understanding, life's so demanding

Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it, we left empty handed

Can I come see you tonight?
Is there someone new now, what can I do now?

Pick up the phone

[Intro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
It’s the only way we know
Let’s keep the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why’d we ball so hard?
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m no afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die

Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
We’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Send me in a truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I’m Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to 'Vel
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook]

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight
There’s something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?

Oh, I like her style and I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try, can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye bye

  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then we do it again
  (And again and again and again)
We do it again and we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
We want it again and we want it again

So we fake it again, I think we're gonna blow it
And we know it but she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it
Then I waste it again

I can't invite her again
'Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over again

I'm wasting time but she's always on my mind
I can't let her go, oh, she's not the best but she's all that I know
As much as we may try can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye bye

  (And again, and again, and again)

We want it again, and we want it again

We want it again. and we want it again
(Do it again, do it again)
We want it again, we want it again

So I've got a new friend, I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
Well she's like you, but she's not you
Gotta find you again

So we remember again, the middle of December
And I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over
It's another again

  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, it's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
I love her, it's another again

Heaven only know, heaven only know

Last night was the worst night, beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic, things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine, I don't understand

There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, oh, you always seem to blame me
But now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go? Will I ever know? Heaven only knows

Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

Let's make this night the best night, it's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking words get drowned on by the sound
So let's get back to touch and we'll get back on solid ground

Let's hold hands like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no, heaven only knows

Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?

Make this night the best night, it's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance

That you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

Where is the love?
You said was mine all mine
Till the end of time
Was it just a lie? Where is the love?

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hanging on the promise there
You gotta let me go

Coot the day what a day why you shoot her nigga, (oh oh no, oh oh no)

If I had a dollar for every shoot beat you know how reach I would be
Like they say it is what it is, now what it could be,
Can't cry feel guilt over spilt milk,
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to versace silk,
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches just bad timing
The chick I met at the club was cute,
Still feel like I'm game brain from the substitute,
'Cause this ain't you and I ain't me,
Plan you happy then why you're so mad at me,
Can't hold on of what you had just what you got,
You should be here, but you're not.

She is beautiful but she's not you
Love is just a night, then out of my life

I pretended it didn't hurt me,
But ever late here I can hardly breathe,
Laying next to she when in reality, it should be

Wish that was somewhere that I could go bad,
It's obvious and there's no doubt,
Made a mistake and I'm down and now,
Uh girl it should be.

My life lights camera fame in action,
Feeling dreams from all this proper planes I'm cashin
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin for a night
Back up for us, exchangin pain in passion,
Romances, tryin to like the fame of those he used to ride,
Ca'use it's tryin to open up and slice suicide,
God teaches lessons every day,
Use all I needed like met them every day,
The sun don't shine forever
Any time that we fall I just need to climb together,
Guess we avoided when we couldn't went through
That don't change the fact that it should'be been you.

Cupid got a big gun but a blindfold

She gave another brother access to her little black dress
You know the one, short silky and backless
You need an Oscar, as she was an actress
I called and met someone, into the mattress

Now shes lying to my face
Eyes burning up like her words was mace
I don't even hear what she was trying to say
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable
To the lies I'm deaf
All I can here is to the left, to the left
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket
Your stuff, I already packed it
Mm being polite.

I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
I'm just trying to be polite

And if I seem a bit chill
It's because I don't sweat the small
Find another girl, please believe I will
I ain't tripping off you at all
A boss from the beginning
Been there for a minute
So me losing you was me still me winning
Found out about you sinning
So you wonder what the hell I'm dreaming

Now you're lying to my face
Eyes burning up like her words was mace
I don't even hear what you're was trying say
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable
To the lies I'm deaf
All I can here is to the left to the left
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket
Your stuff, I already packed it
I'm being polite

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
I'm just trying to be polite

Please don't get me wrong
Baby understand I'm trying to say get gone, the nicest way I can
'Cause I'm not what you want
See I tried to make this work but our loves in the dirt, so lets See who calls who first
I'm moving along

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along...
I'm just trying to be polite
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
I'm just trying to be polite",Soul/R&B

She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothing in this world sexy
Than a girl that want but don't need me

Young, independent, yeah she work hard
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon' shine

She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays aggressive but she still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin' in her eyes

Knowin' she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin' for her throne

I love her cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own

I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it

I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothin' that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me

Lovely face, nice thick thighs
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy Thang, she's McFly
All the while payin' the bills on time

She don't look at me like Captain Save 'Em
Gold diggin', no she don't do that
Now she lookin' me like inspiration
She wanna be complimentin' my swag

And everything she got, she work for it, good life made for it
She take pride in sayin' that she paid for it
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin' for her throne

I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her cause she got her own
She got her own

I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it
Oh she say, uh uh, I got it, I got it, I got it

Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too
Make you even have to, but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to
When I do that math boo, you always try to add two

I need someone who'd ride for me, not someone who'd ride for free
She said boy I don't just ride, she'll pull up beside of me
I had to ask her what she doin' in that caddy
She said 'cause you my baby I'd be stuntin' like my daddy

And there's not many who catch my eye
We both wearing Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by the side, toaster in the holster

And now she went low so, case you didn't know so
You can save your money dawg, shawty gettin' dough so
What she care wit his cars? You can call her miss boss
Y'all got it backwards, criss cross, shawty got her own

Got her own
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own

It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it

It was something magical, story with status
You know what I mean?
And I must repeat that I’m not trying to offend
But there ain’t no use in even trying to pretend
Cause nobody else compares
None of you do, sorry it’s true
But to each and everyone of you, this is me saying that I’m through
I’m not trying to hurt anybody but,
Enough is enough, there can be no more us
Because of what I just found
I found love, so I gotta go,
I found love, nah I ain’t playing no more, whoa
And I apologize, whoa, but this is goodbye
I found love, wasn’t looking for it
I found love, but I can’t ignore it, whoa
And I apologize, whoa, but this is goodbye
Ah, ah, ah, said I don’t mean to hurt your feelings
But this love I’m feeling, is so real, I love this
So I guess it just is what it is, yeah, yeah
Oy, said I don’t mean to hurt your feelings
But this love I’m feeling, is so real, I love this
So I guess it just is what it is, yeah, yeah

I gotta go, I really gotta go right now

You went to see her then came home
Come on now brother

I'd rather fight with you, you hear me
I'd rather fight with you, than make love to somebody else

I can't stand it when you get cranky, I despise it
Even though more than half of the time it's my fault
You don't like nothing that I like, right when your left
And left when you're right
Oh but if it ain't you girl, I'll take nobody at all

Way that it feels, feels to be lonely
May you never know one day when love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only

Maybe in a perfect world
We would get along perfectly
But seeing how this is real life
Sometimes we just wanna be

And I may make you say you wanna leave
Never come back but I don't

Is I said how she look me up and down she said lets go
So we went to her spot off the back blazin hot clothes
Cam off it was on headboard broke mind was blown

After the session she checked the messages on her cell..
All of the sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as
Hell...the message said hey baby surprise surprise girl im free
I'll be home around 3 and it was already 3:15...she said (hurry up)

Grab ya shoes (hurry up)
Grab ya clothes (hurry up)
Cause my mans comin' home (she said hurry up)
Hit the street (hurry up)
Disappear (hurry up)
Ya gotta get outta here baby hes crazy...believe me he'll kill u...
Leave ya number I'll call you whatever words you need to (hurry up)

[Verse 2:]
She said he stood bout 7'9..
Killed some cat for lookin' at her and got 25 to life...
But somehow he's out today and this fool is on his way
Hell snap yo neck and not think twice...
Get your shit and goodnight (hurry)
Now I ain't trippin' cause it ain't a man alive I fear (naw)...
So I'm draggin around ever so slowly puttin on my gear...
Grabbed my jeans off da floor suddenly keys in the door...
She changed the locks that bought me time but still this dude it right outside.

[Verse 3:]
She said get under the bed like thats a good place to hide..
He kicked down the door no hello 
He just goes who car is that outside

Put it to my head guess I should have listened when she said....  (Hurry up)

And I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you

There are sirens all around and the streets are mean

Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God

Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down
From Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight
With a hunger for more than an empty fridge

As it will go on forever
Noise, always noise
Candles burn, lights are low
I haven't a place to go

Life in it's constant state of moving nowhere
The music is nice, floats through the air
Sounds of waves crashing everywhere
Percussive submissions, mind conditions
Writing with the left hand
Unknowing and taking the chance

Why not fly? Why not try?
This constant game I play to stay high
But all is just a state of mind
All is reality of your choice
Constant evolution, constant adaptation
Constant state of moving nowhere

Footsteps, silence is loud
Kindness is brave, wisdom is long
Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it
Searching, looking for the satisfaction
It is nowhere, it is everywhere

Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come
What are we waiting for?
Why are we so afraid of taking charge?
But it's always changing, always
In the constant state of going nowhere

We all have demons to battle, roads to walk
Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins
Candles and their steady glow
Water and its constant crash

Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone
Still strong, still here and so are we
Here we are forever
The constant state of going nowhere

The constant state of going nowhere
Constant state of going nowhere
Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere
Constant state of moving nowhere

It's like a jungle
It's like a jungle

It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the streets of New York

All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people
Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time

I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through
Now you wanna be up under me
Now you have so much to say to me

Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you're supposed to do
No need to approach me fool, 'cuz I'm over you

Wasn’t anything special you said, it was just there.
Right then, I didn’t have time even overthink it,
I looked at you and all of a sudden I was all in.

It’s like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing, taking all of my air.
From that moment on it was very clear.

That’s when I knew you are the one,
That’s when I knew you stole my heart away from me.

That was the moment that I knew I was in love.
That’s when I know, that’s when I know,
That’s when I know that day.

And I know where we’re going when the night would end,
I know if there was something wrong and if it was
I don’t know how much I’ve cared.
That touch when you barely held my hand I was overcome
With feeling I don’t understand,
Not in a million years I didn’t think that we’d be here.

It’s like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing, taking all of my air.

And there’s nothing I ain’t and know this for real.
There’s nothing to do, just that there ain’t got to surrender.

Doing the one you claim to love wrong

'Cause you be poppin' hood, you get it poppin'

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losin' your mind
It's confusin' you, you're confused you know
Why you wastin' your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Gaspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'

Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you trippin'
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me

There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need

Don't care about presents

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
(And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
(So brightly baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
(Oh)

And everyone is singing
(Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own

[Verse 1:]
I gotta take a little time*
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder

[Hook:]
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus:]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me

[Verse 2:]
Gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love's finally found me

[Hook:]
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is (feel what love is)

One Sweet Day (feat. Boyz II Men)


Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be togetherOne sweet day

Darling, I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself

â€~Cause I didn't know you
â€~Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
â€~Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, â€~cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me

""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""

And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
And it's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together

Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high, we will never say bye

Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky â€~cause we will never say bye

As a child there were them times
I didn't get it but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
It's something more than saying, â€½I miss youâ€
But when we talked too

All them grown full things separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show
Because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way try not to cry
As time goes by

And soon as you reached a better place
Still I'll give the whole world to see your face
And I'm bragging next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together

I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong that you can make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way try not to cry

And soon as you reached a better place

Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed

Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body

I'm sayin', Boo, the type I'd give my last name to 
At Lovers Lane put the top up 
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot 
Then we finish doin' our thing 
Fog the windows gettin' very sentimental 
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle 
I keep it honest, word to real, that's my promise 
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus 

Thank God I found you 
I was so lost without you 
My every wish and every dream 
Somehow became reality",Soul/R&B

You always smile
But in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go

And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If livin' is without you
I can't give
I can't give any more

I can't live
If livin' is without you

Your sorrow shows

Santa, if you get this letter won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how you do the things you do
While I sleep on Christmas Eve

But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside and I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself

So I hope Rudolph and them other 8 reindeer
Get you safely here so you can scoop him up
And scoop him right down my chimney

I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
Make this Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help

They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick

'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh, I promise
That I won't forget the milk and cookies

The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole

Jay-Z/Mariah: 

All right let's go (ooh) 

Mariah: 

Give me your love x 16


Jay-Z/Clue: 

Uh, what, uh, jigga (MC, ha, Clue) 
Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this 
You almost gotta watch to this, uh-huh (who-ee) 
Escape 

Mariah: 

Ooh your love's so good 
I don't wanna let go 
And although I should 
I can't leave you alone (ha, ha) 
Cause you're so disarming 
I'm caught up in the midst 
Of you, and I can not resist, (sing the song) oh 

Mariah:

Boy if I do 
The things you want me to 
The way I used to do 
Would you love me baby? 
Holding me, feeling me, would you go and break my heart?

Chorus:

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart

Mariah/Clue:

Give me your love 
Give me your love (She said) 
Give me your love (She wants) 
Give me your love 
Give me your love (She said) 
Give me your love (Uh-huh) 
Give me your love (Yeah) 
Give me your love 

(Get him back) 
It's a shame to be 
So euphoric and weak 
When you smile at me 
And you tell me the things 
That you know just maybe could relinquish my love to you 
But I can not resist (ha, ha) oh no

Mariah:

Boy if I do 
The things you want me to

Jay-Z: 

I'm all on the record 
Okay, Clue all right 
She wanna shop with Jay 
She wanna play box with Jay 
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night 
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends 
She wanna creep past the block, spying again 
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away 
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date 
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb 
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers 
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies 
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie 
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm 
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom 
She calls me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her 
Want a piece of paper, scribble down ""I Hate Ya"" 
But she knows she loves Jay because 
Cause she loves everything Jay say, Jay does and uh

Chorus:

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
I should have known right from the start

Oh why did you have to run your game on me?

But I just keep on coming back incessantly

Can't you see I'm dying here
A shot of broken heart that is chased with fear?

Intentions that were pure have turned obscure
Seconds into hours, minutes into years
Don't ask me why

Tearing me silently, although abruptly words can't hide
As I'm taking you home and I tried to see
Tried to understand your words as I'm taking you home

Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me

It took so long still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights, felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong, so I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive, I'm so thankful that I perceived
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny

And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

Prayed through the nights so faithfully

It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun

If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage to be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me
When you're ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun

If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I can't pretend these tears aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye for you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun

If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

Appreciates all the love I give

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say, ""I told you so""

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

Jumped in your ride and took off

Cold world
I never thought I see that day that you're my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls

Shotgun in the drop made her right
Hut one, hut two, told them niggas take a hike
Then it's on to the next one, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes
I wondered if I was wrong
Trying to do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause I hide our closeness and I don't compare at all
And I bet all they do is distract me
But now deep down, when I face it all I want is you, all I want is you
All I want is you now now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend is killing me softly
I hear voices, wondering where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time, I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausted

'Cause I hide our closeness and I don't compare at all
And I bet all they do is distract me
But now deep down, when I face it all I want is you, all I want is you
All I want is you now, sugar, now that you're gone, gone, gone

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you, now
Baby, now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

'Cause they don't smile or smell like you
And they don't make me laugh or even cook like you
And they don't photograph, nah they don't sex like you
Let's face it, I can't replace it, that's why all I want is you

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal
Trying to celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I'm kidding, still sick, real shit
All my new bitches seem to get old real quick

And could it be you everything these plain bitches couldn't be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl, you gotta a hold on me

I say I'm wrong, you say ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look, don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of ho's, how they coming in

Just saying, you don't wanna have me, then somebody will
I'm playing, weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying, you ain't content with trying to do your thang
Then, come back, baby boomerang

All I want is you, all I want is you
All I want is you now, sugar, now that you're gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, all I want is you
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone I want you back",Soul/R&B

[J.Cole:]
Damn, Cold World*
I never thought I see that day that you're my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, Got two, three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one, Hut two, told them niggas take a hike
Then it's on to the next, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 1: ~Miguel~]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna' do right by you got me here
Now All I Am Is Alone

Cause her eyes
And those hips
And that (ass)
Don't compare, at all (no)
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it

[Chorus:]
All I Want Is You
All I Want Is You (now)
All I Want Is You Now
Now That Your Gone, Gone, Gone

[Verse 2:]
Cause being a friend, was killing me softly
Hear voices
Wondering where I went wrong
It was my fault, in the wrong time,
I wonder so often, with records exhausting

Cause her eyes
And those hips
And that (ass)
Don't compare, at all (no)
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it

[Chorus:]
All I Want Is You (Mhhm)
All I Want Is You (now)
All I Want Is You Now (Sugar)
Now That Your Gone, Gone, Gone

All I Want Is You (Mhhm)
All I Want Is You (now)
All I Want Is You Now (Baby)
Now That Your Gone, Gone, Gone

[Bridge:]
Cause they don't smile
Or smell like you
No they don't make me laugh
Or even cook like you
And they don't photograph
Nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now...

[J.Cole:]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal
Trying to celebrate my Independence Day Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding
Still sick Real sh! t
All my new bitches seem to get old real quick
Could it be you everything these plain bitches couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the Player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, Girl you gotta a hold on me

I say I'm wrong, You say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes,
Look how they coming in
Just saying
You don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do your thang
Hey come back baby boomerang

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why
All I Want Is You Now (Mhhm)

Say the words and it’s there
You put up with the rumours and they blog what you wear
His and her everything, charge for the pair
Couldn’t let you cluster when I’m all solitaire’s
Share and share alike, I never fear the price
Top of my game, I hope you ain't scared of heights
Roll a dice, you can bet that, never gotta sweat that

Looking pretty on my arms what you best at

Did you see the whole show?
So where's all the fun
That we used to know?
As the memories fade
Way out of view
I'd love those old days
To come back to you

I've been waiting so long
I'm not feeling so strong

Did you say what you mean?
Did you mean what you say?
About this new scene
Is it really that way?
But the blindness goes on
You say it's not so
But what do you know?

I've been waiting so long
I'm not feeling so strong

Ain't nothing new, it's just the same old thing
You got me singing those old blues again

Angry music, words of fire
Painted faces filled with rage
Even then they sound so tired
I must be set in my old ways

If this world is unimpressive
It's been that way for quite awhile
I don't need no heavy message
Just turn me on and make me smile

Yes I've been waiting such a long time
Just for something to ring true
Now I'd rather taste the old wine
Than mess around with something new

And the blindness goes on
The blindness goes on

Don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Leave me out in the pouring rain
With my back against the wall
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Leave me out with nowhere to go
And the shadows start to fall
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Leave me out on this lonely road
As the wind begins to howl
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
All alone on this darkest night
Feeling old and cold and grey
Don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Leave me holding an empty heart
As the curtain starts to fall
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
All alone in this crazy world
When I'm old and cold and grey and time is gone.

But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes not from burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

While oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his prilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
There's no rest in the west, so to the east he goes, to the east he goes
Where he can find peace of mind, oh",Soul/R&B

The sheep are scattered all around.
Over hills and valleys,
They are everywhere to be found.
But though we bear our burdens now,
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough.

Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree.

But you got to come home with me

I forgot some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get to thrown it on you
You got to come runnin' back for more

Once it come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle

You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand?

His bleeks was white as snow
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
And that was against the rule
He made the children laugh and play
You've seen that lamb, oh that lamb in school

Mary had a little lamb
  (Oh Mary)
Mary had a little lamb
  (Listen, let me tell you something)

Ever since I was four years old
I hated a silly rule
Ever since they ran Mary's lamb
Oh, all the way you're home from school

You should have seen Mary cry
When she waved to her lamb goodbye
The teacher said, ""Mary come inside
Come on and dry, oh, dry your eyes""

Mary had a little lamb
  (Oh, oh, oh Mary)
Mary had a little lamb
  (Wait a minute)

Mary, don't you be so blue
And bring that lamb back to school
And Mary don't you be no fool
You see the lamb daily through

When you go, oh, home today
You and your lamb can play
You can even do the twist
And then it goes something like this

Mary had a little lamb
  (Oh, oh, oh Mary)
Mary had a little lamb
  (Oh, oh, oh Mary)


Mary had a little lamb
  (Come on Mary)
Mary had a little lamb
  (Don't you be such a moaner)

Mary had a little lamb

I gotta find me a way, less-demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together all of our lives

And I, I had some big idea
So much of my life, still not completed, hopes and fears
Watching it change, into something new
Wondering it I'm gonna find the answer, loving you

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I gotta find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting what's mine
I gotta find me a way, less-demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together all of our lives

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's an ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's an ever changing time

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I gotta find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting what's mine
I gotta find me a way, less-demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together
And we're gonna be alright, together all of our lives

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time

I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's a ever changing time

We can't quit till we get
To the other side

With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' on
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about slowin', slowin' down, yeah

With the wind and your fingers in my hand
Kind of think we are going for an extended throw down
So drop the top, baby, and let's cruise on into
This better than ever street

Get over in the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh, yeah
Take the love exit, and then make a right turn
Go on over to love and satisfaction and joy
Well, ain't we ridin' baby
Ain't we cruisin' down?
Free, free, free, freeway
Go on out to, ow

A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff

There's this thing you do to me, that thing that makes me weak

Revolved around you day and night

Find who I wanna be

Seein' a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me in someone else's eyes

Gotta finally take control, gotta see myself as whole with you
Though you're not the one to blame, I was lost inside your name
And I'll never be the same till I find a way back home again

Makes it, makes it easier
Easier to bear

But in my mind it's a mystery
Feeling the pain then I feel the love
And once again you're the world to me

Hey, what is this thing I'm feeling, baby?
What are these strange emotions?
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply

It's almost midnight
And my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town

You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love and a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And my soul's on fire
Looking for love and a girl for me

Memories of our love obsesses
If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine",Soul/R&B

I've been in love more or less
With a dream that will last me
A lifetime, baby

Other dreams, I have lost
But whatever the cost
The parade isn't passing me by
No, no, no, no, no, darling

So if the picture I paint
Makes me a sinner, or makes me a saint
I won't try, no, not I
To deny it, woo, oh

I may cry with the past
But it's easier to laugh about it
When I think of my wonderful life
I thank God for my wonderful life",Soul/R&B

And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs

Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby

Close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my life

All the things I did seems I've done 'em before

But you brightened up all my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

I would've still felt bad, ah baby

Ah baby, I simply let my tear drop fall like rain
Oh baby, but when I kiss your lips
The clouds begin to roll away

She told me, son love goes where you take it

Your music makes me want to sing

When living for my life was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain falling down?
Tell me how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
It would be that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow

So how can you mend a broken heart? And mine is
How can you stop the rain falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

And sometimes after saying, say
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah, la, la, la, la
Tell me, help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna live again, baby

How can you mend this broken man?
Somebody tell me, and how can a loser ever win?
Baby, help me mend this old broken heart
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
I feel like I'm going to live again

How can you mend this broken heart?
Somebody please tell me
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart

Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
I want to let His praises swell
Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water and it was not in the well

Well, there was a woman from Samaria
Came to the well to get some water
There she met a stranger who did a story tell
That woman dropped her pitcher she drank and was made richer
From the water He gave her and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water
Jesus gave her water, Jesus gave her water
I want to let His praises swell
Jesus gave her water, He gave that woman water
He gave her living, loving, lasting water and it was not in the well

Well, on that woman He had pity she ran back to the city
Crying glory, Hallelujah and did His wonders tell
She left my Savior singing, she came back to him bringing
The town to see that water Lord and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water
Jesus gave her water, Jesus gave her water
I want to let His praises swell
Jesus gave that woman water
Gave her living, loving, lasting water and it was not in the well

Well, Lord that woman left for shoutin'
There was no room for doubtin'
That she had met a Savior who did her wonders tell
Every time she doubt Him, she start to think about Him
The man that gave her that water Lord and he was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water

Tell you He gave that woman water

Why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
But I was a mere lad of sixteen and I've aged a year since then

She was only sixteen, only sixteen with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love and I was too young to know

Oh it never will happen again

And I find that they have troubles too

And I've got sisters and brothers, they don't like me
Because I'm away from sin
And I've got good friends, my best friends they turned against me
Because I'm a trial so hard to win

Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, come on, Jesus

Got molecules, i possess
Ever more nothing less

Here in the dark
I think im starting to feel something

Keep burning up

Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Mob to the bride, I'm
Keeping the faith, I'm
Holding the fight, A
Hell of a night
It's a hell of a night

Love me for nothing
Dont even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Dont even love me for free

Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one
(one one one one)
Live like I'm living today
Live like today was my last one
(one one one one)

Falling from this high
(falling falling)
From this high
(one one one one)

Love me for nothing
Dont even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Dont even love me for free

All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real

All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real",Soul/R&B

I'm tired of time travel
I wanna stay here with my thoughts
Wish they'd stay
Misunderstood
I'm miseducated
Umm
You should just save me

I just wanna live
How it should be
Or what
What it is
Or what
Can i get a heartbreak
Or what
Unstick my thoughts
Unstick my heart
Unstick these words
Go from the start

Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality
Drag me to the truth

Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then jus so
Look with the light, i see
Top of my sight im scared
Can't sleep at night",Soul/R&B

come catch me
strip me in chains until i bleed

thats why should i stay here
why should i fight it?
i won't, i won't

You see, He sees the world is full of confusion
People not knowing who to trust
No, He’s wondering why we still can’t be
In this world He gave us. 

It’s about time we submit to the master plan
And bring all this pain and war to an end
Well, He said it’s about time for a brand new day; and a brand new world to begin.

Somebody told me
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
And I pass it on, pass it to you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message9
I’m sure you know who, you know who.

You see, she’s a child who’s dying of hunger
And another man just looking good
Yea, He’s wondering why that man hasn’t need for thought for about loving that baby if he could

He woke me up this morning – yes He did
And this is what He had to say:
He said, “Get on up; go out and tell the world
That this day is a brand new day”
He woke me up
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He said pass it on, pass it on

It’s about time we submit to the master plan
And bring all this pain and war to an end
Well, He said it’s about time for a brand new day; and a brand new world to begin

Somebody woke me up this morning and told me to tell you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He said pass it on to you
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
And I’m pretty sure, I’m pretty sure you know who
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
You see, it’s a brand new day, brand new, brand new
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
He gave His only begotten son
So that you and I can live
You and I, You and I, You and I can live

Well
You see a long time ago
When I was about 10 years old
Speaking:
If you read in Proverbs 25:13
You’d see where it says:
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
He said get on up, get on up
Get on up, go out and tell the world

(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
That the time is coming; time is coming 
When the world will have to come to an end.
(Somebody told me to deliver this message)
Ah, you better be ready; you better be ready
Ah, Time waits for no one, no
You better be ready children
You got to be ready",Soul/R&B

I could still remember the last time

But all those days have come and gone now
And all I seem to do is cry

Could last throughout eternity

Was meant to be

This time you'd see
You would have all my love

Well, have you got somebody else
Yes, I've got somebody too
But you know I've finally realized
No one could ever take the place of you, no

I'm not the one to place the blame
Or for whatever the fault just might be
All I need is to find a little happiness
Oh, in life that will fulfill me

It's you

It's you that means more to me
Without your love
It's nothin' more than fantasy

Since you and I've being together
So much time till I
I don't know quite how to start

All I know is that from that day until this
You remain on my mind and in my heart
You know I was never really clear
Just what went wrong

I guess that's why I had to write this song

You know everybody uses the phrase I love you so loosely
I bet you couldn't count the times you've said I love you
Some people are confused, they think liking is loving
Oh, but there's a big difference between liking and love

You know this calls to mind the last time you told me you loved me
So the next time you say I love you
I want you to know exactly what love really is

Love is not jealous, love it does not brag
Love don't get puffed up, love it never fails, it never fails
So tell me, tell me that you love me
Now that you know what love really, really, really is
So tell me, tell me, tell me that you love me
Come on, tell me, show me that your love is real, that your love is real

Know love rejoices over truth
Sometimes the truth hurts but will stand the test of time
You know love bears all things and believes all things
Love hopes all things and endures all things
So the next time you tell me you love me
I want you to know exactly what you're saying

'Cause love is not selfish, love is not provoked, no no no
Love is long suffering, love is oh so kind, it's oh so kind
Now tell me, tell me that you love me
Now that you know what love, really, really, really is
Now tell me, tell me, tell me that you love me
Come on, tell me, show me that your love is real

Is it real? Is it real what you feel?

Is it real what you feel?
You tell me you love me
Can you look me in my eyes and say you love me?
Now that you know what love is

Is it real what you feel?
'Cause if not, you're liking instead of loving
Tell me is it real?
I got to know what you feel
'Cause what I feel is real

I can stand right here and say I love you
I can stand right here and say I love you baby
Now that you know what love is, is it real?

(W. King, S. King, H. Hudson - 1981)

Lady - you bring me up when I'm down,
Maybe you're gonna change my life around.

You came to me when I was lonely and no one cared.
You made me see that I was only just runnin' scared.
I saw your face and somethin' told me you were the one.
You smiled at me and now I see: My life's begun.

Lady - you brought me in from out the rain,
Maybe me life will never be the same.

Once I was filled with desperation - a solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration like only true love can.
Now I believe in what you're sayin' - I'm ten feet tall.
This love don't need no explainin' - we've got it all.

A captain to take us through the storm
What makes a soldier ride alone into battle
Can anybody tell me where he's coming from

He's that stranger on the street
He's that child who's at your feet
Searching for freedom and justice
You've seen him time and again, you know they only fight to win
They're the challengers evil and I'm glad we know them

419,Leon Bridges,http://www.songlyrics.com/leon-bridges/shy-lyrics/,"Staring at the ceiling
Hearts and records spinning, round
I've been, loving with no meaning
Crawling from a feeling, that
You know that I want you

Mmm, don't get me started at this time of night
Hard to keep my guard up and the feeling's right
I don't need nobody but for you I might
And all that want is you

I just wanna teach you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy, it's alright

I just wanna teach you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy
You can be shy, with me

Met you back in August
Thought you were standoffish, coy
But you don't have to try
I'll read between your lines
'Cause darling I want you
Ohh ohh ohh why?

You ain't gonna have what you want tonight
No, take your time
We can move slow, put your hips on mine
Hey, you're so shy
Why don't come round here and waste my time
'Cause all that I want is you

I just wanna teach you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy, shy
It's alright

I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
'Cause baby I need you
And I'm kinda shy too
Maybe tonight, baby
You can be shy
You can be shy, with me",Soul/R&B
420,Leon Bridges,http://www.songlyrics.com/leon-bridges/bet-ain-t-worth-the-hand-lyrics/,"I better slow down
'Cause I keep, keep trippin' on words I don't wanna say
Just tell me right now
'Cause I keep, keep seein' the signs you want me to stay

I can't commit, I can't make plans
Sometimes the bet ain't worth the hand
I think you're special, it makes me sad
Don't wanna wonder what we could've had
And I hope you understand

Don't get your feelings broken for nothin'
Maybe I'm leavin'
Leavin' here with nothin'
I might regret that I can't be your man
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
And I can't keep lettin' this wave carry me away
So tell me right now
'Cause I keep, keep seein' the signs you want me to stay

I got it bad
I think you know
You're everything, you're beautiful
But my life is fast, can't make it slow
We're here right now
Kiss me before I go, but you got to let me go

Don't get your feelings broken for nothin'
Maybe I'm leavin'
Leavin' here with nothin'
I might regret that I can't be your man
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
(I been hurt before, don't wanna hurt no more)
(I been hurt before)
But sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
(I been hurt before, don't wanna hurt no more)
(I been hurt before)
I gotta let ya know, girl
I can't let it go any longer
(I been hurt before)
Sometimes it ain't worth the hand",Soul/R&B

But I got a heart that's strong
And a love that's tall
Ain't got no name, ain't got no fancy education
But I can see right through
A powdered face on a painted fool

Let me slip through (Let me slip through)
Why you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)
I'm just tryna move up front
Lil more of this, lil less of that (Can you feel me?)
Let me come through (Let me come through)
I'm tired being in the back (Aight)
I'm just tryna move up front
A lil more of this, a lil less of that, yeah

They tell me I was born to lose
But I made a good good thing out of bad bad news

I don't worry, don't worry, don't worry about people in my face
I hit ‘em with the style and grace
And watch their ankles break
I know you wish, I know you wish I would fade away
But I got more to say, Lord they pray

Let me slip through (Let me slip through)
Why you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)
I'm just tryna move up front
Lil more of this, lil less of that (Can you feel me?)
Let me come through (Let me come through)
I'm tired being in the back (Aight)
I'm just trynna move up front
A lil more of this, a lil less of that, yeah

They tell me I was born to lose
But I made a good good thing out of bad bad news

Alright alright, all day all night
Alright alright, all day all night
Alright alright, all day all night
Alright alright, all day all night

They tell me I was born to lose
But I made a good good thing out of bad bad news",Soul/R&B

Brown skin girl staring with her brown eyes
Ooh, baby, don't you know you're a cutie pie?
Princess, little honey with the polka-dot dress on
Ruby-lipped lady whose name I don't know
Let me tell you, darling
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh whoo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh whoo-ooh, OK
Brown skin girl with the white pearls 'round her neck
Brown skin girl, let me hold you close under the white moon

I just wanna be a better man
To my baby, mhm
Meet me off good luck
I was singing with them Jezebels
Under perfume sheets, mhm
Got a golden smile, hard to inflow
a innocent love, but it wasn't enough

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

All night long I was out
Out till the morning
But baby your tender
Lost when I'm longing
Baby please, I'm down on my knees begging
Uh, I thirst for you girl
Baby I'm running to your well
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart

My heart's been far from you
Ten-thousand miles gone

Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
Every part of me
But there is blood on my hands
And my lips aren't clean

In my darkness I remember
Momma's words reoccur to me
""Surrender to the good Lord
And he'll wipe your slate clean""

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Oh, go on
Take me to your river
I wanna know

Tip me in your smooth waters
I go in
As a man with many crimes
Come up for air
As my sins flow down the Jordan

Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
Every part of me
But there is blood on my hands
And my lips aren't clean

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Go on,
Take me to your river
I wanna know

I wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Lord, please let me know
Take me to your river
I wanna know",Soul/R&B
